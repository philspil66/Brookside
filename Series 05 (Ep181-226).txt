The closing credits continue to be rolled over an image of the Close. Episode 208, however, ends with George Jackson being led into a prison cell - there is a long freeze-frame of him, and the picture suddenly turns black with the accompanying sound effect of a slamming cell door - the credits begin on this black background, then the normal image of the Close gradually fades in. Episodes 225 and 226 end with a short fade to black, followed by the cast and crew waving from the Close. For these two episodes, a single alphabetical listing of all the crew and performers replaces the traditional format for the credits.

Arthur Kelly becomes the third performer to play a second credited role. Previously Dromgoole in episode 13, he reappears as elusive spare parts man Wilf. He would return later for a longer-running role as Laura Wright's father.

Several of the performers of other minor roles in this season would also return as other characters later on - including Marji Campi, who, uniquely, would have played three different widows by the time the series ended!!

The storylines:

One storyline dominates this season - George Jackson's accidental descent into crime and imprisonment, including its knock-on effects such as Barry and Terry being turned into "video nasties"........ Elsewhere on the Close, Harry and Edna become the first couple to move from one house to another, heralding the arrival of new tenants Kate, Sandra and Pat. Bobby, Paul and Heather continue to be most frequently seen at work - especially Heather, who has some successful assignments at her new firm - while most of the younger characters develop their personal and business relationships.


The dates:

It is reasonable to suppose that most scenes are set on approximately the dates on which the episodes were originally aired. There are only occasional more specific references that it is Saturday (197, 202, 204); Sunday (198 ); Tuesday (199); and Friday (205). The T.U.C. conference is in progress during episodes 193 and 194, and the Liberals are in Bournemouth in episode 197. There is a November calendar on the wall in episode 200, and a big "13" on Joyce's desk-calendar in episode 214. During George's trial, his offences are alleged to have occurred between the 1st and the 8th of August 1984 (207), and the car containing incriminating evidence was found on August 8th (208 ). It is Christmas Eve in episode 225, and Christmas Day in episode 226.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in Liverpool, except that Karen and Andrew visit Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where they encounter Jackie Armstrong and Bandit, in episode 204; and Heather and Stuart are seen in Manchester in episode 220, and in Birmingham in episodes 221 and 222. The Birmingham scenes in episode 222 also feature Greg and the un-named Caretaker, who was evidently born there!

Births:

None, though by episode 210 Sheila is seven months' pregnant, We learn, however that Rose has given birth to a baby girl in Ireland (220), and that Samantha is also now pregnant (226). We are also told that Marie is 35 (186), the twins are now 11 (187), Damon is still 16 (192), Barry is still 25 (213), Harry is 66 (216), Gordon is still 16 (221), and Annabelle is 47 (222). Sandra is a year older than Pat (201), and Edna is two years younger than Harry (202). There are a few birthdays mentioned, especially Karen's - in episode 192, she is 18 "next week", in episode 193 it is "tomorrow", and in episode 194 the great day finally arrives. In episode 187, Heather's birthday was "last week"; and in episode 207 it is Sheila's birthday - by episode 221, she is 44. In episode 210, it will be Paul's 60th birthday on Friday [presumably 2nd November, or possibly 9th November], so his star sign is Scorpio. In episode 211 Heather gives him a belated birthday present.

Marriages:

None, although we are told that Rose and Timmy have become engaged (195), Edna and Harry have been married for forty-seven and a half years (203). and Annabelle says she has been a wife and mother for 20 years (222).

Deaths:

One - in episode 214 Edna learns that while she and Harry were on holiday, Grace Hardwick has died of pneumonia, following a fall, and was buried two days later. Terry mentions in episode 185 that his mother died three years ago this month, although it would later transpire that he had been slightly misled about this........ Bobby mentions in the same episode that he had an uncle Brendan, so presumably he doesn't any more. In episode 190, Yvonne's opening gambit in her bid to chat up Gizzmo is that she really loved her gran, who died last year. Mrs Lyons' husband has recently died in episode 197, and Sammy's mother reveals in episode 198 that his father is no longer alive. In episode 206, it is a year since Petra died.

Toilet visits:


Just three - Rose (187), Sheila (193), and Terry (224). George, however, has the "runs" in episode 190.

Goofs:

A question we were possibly meant to hear Annabelle asking, "Where do they live?" appears to have gone missing in episode 197. Asked whether she has any children, Mrs Lyons replies: "Two girls and a boy.......Edinburgh, Newcastle and Cardiff." (If Annabelle wondered why the widow had named all her children after cities, she was too polite to mention it!)

In episode 202, Harry's tenses seem confused: "I knOw all about that sort of thing before you were thought of".

Karen has two goes at saying "Liverpool" while talking to Jackie Armstrong in episode 204.

In episodes 207 and 208, the fire George attended was at "Carson's Bonded Warehouse", but in episode 184 it had been at "Spence's Warehouse".

At one point in episode 212, Joyce refers to NSAOS as "North Thames......." instead of "North Sands.......".

In episode 217, Stuart asks Heather how many hours a week she works; and, ludicrously, she replies "I don't keep a count.". As a chartered accountant in a major firm, in which all of the professional staff would be working on the affairs of several different clients, billed on the basis of the grade of staff used and hours spent, she would have to maintain a detailed ongoing record of her work and the time spent on it, and complete a weekly or monthly time-sheet.

In episode 222, Heather introduces Greg to Stuart as "McAdams" instead of "McAdam". She's his boss, so he doesn't correct her!

Trivia:

Annabelle, who was named after her grandmother (207), suggests to Paul that they should get the latest gadget, a Teletext television (226). Paul isn't convinced, although he could probably afford one - his current annual salary is £13-14k (190). This is their first Christmas alone for 19 years (225).

The managing partner (the "great white chief") at Hamilton and Devereux is Howard Drucker (211). The North Sands Amateur Operatic Society (NSAOS) was established in 1937, and has always been audited by Hamilton and Devereux (212). It has been the bane of Joyce's life for six years (212). Lynne Dearman is its honorary treasurer and, according to Jane Drucker, sings like a fingernail on a blackboard (212).

Flashbacks:

In episode 181 there are three flashbacks of Roger and Heather from earlier episodes; and episode 209 features a flashback of Marie and George from an earlier episode, plus some repeated sequences from episode 208, including previously unseen images of the judge delivering his verdict, "You will go to prison for eighteen months", during which George's reaction had originally been seen on-screen.

"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

This has to be the appearance of Letitia Dean, who would go on to play Sharon Watts in "EastEnders", in episode 190. Still credited even though all her dialogue as Dawn is cut from the episode, she can only be seen on-screen for a few seconds, climbing a stairway.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

After most of the residents have rallied around Harry, who appears to be having a heart attack (it transpires that he is merely being pricked by a pin left in the new shirt he is wearing), Sheila, who has already made one abortive dash to the hospital, pretends that her baby is really now on the way. Bobby races out to the car, then into the house to get Sheila's bag. By the time he has reversed the car in front of the bungalow, however, everyone is outside, with glasses raised, and they wish him a merry Christmas.
