From the beginning of this season, the opening and closing titles sequences and other captions are completely revised, presented in a different font. Although some images from earlier sequences still appear in the left-hand screen of the two which are now used in the ninth "Brookside" opening sequence, the realism of the series is also seriously reduced from this point onwards by the addition of a selection of extracts from the next episode in a similarly-placed screen in the closing sequence, while the unchanged closing music, accompanying the closing credits which roll past on the right, is faded down to enable the forthcoming dialogue to be heard.

Some of the images originally shown in the closing minutes of episode 2259 are repeated in the opening minutes of episode 2260.

Ron marries Anthea, and Katie discovers that Ryan has a secret daughter. Lindsey makes a new friend, and Jackie finds a new vocation, but causes Jimmy to lose his teaching job. Jacqui meets her potential in-laws, and Darren tells Victoria he wants her - but she goes back to Mark when he is diagnosed with an incurable disease. Mick decides to close the chip shop after a brief outbreak of food poisoning, and a more enduring atmosphere of racial tension brought to the Close by Josh, which leads to Jerome and Leo moving out, and an attack on Sinbad leaving him deaf. But the summer of 1999 is really, really not a good time for the Shadwicks - Luke is acquitted of the rape of Nikki, Greg and Jason are both killed by a bomb Callum explodes at the opening of the "Millennium Club", and Margi is rapidly becoming the only resident of the Close who doesn't know that her husband spent the last few months of his life having an affair with Susannah. Will she remain forever ignorant, or can someone eventually be persuaded to gently break this news to her?

The dates:

We are reminded that the day of the party at which Nikki was raped was Wednesday 23rd December 1998 (2233), and the day after was Thursday 24th December 1998 (2234) - both as seen in episode 2153; and we are told that Luke was arrested 18 days later (2234) - as seen in episode 2160 - and released 4 days later (2234) - as seen in episode 2162.

Locations:

Virtually all of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, the only exceptions being a number of scenes in episode 2272, which are set at and near Cuddington Hall, Cheshire.

Births:

None. Rachel is five months pregnant in episode 2254, and we are told that Sandra's unseen niece has recently given birth to an equally unseen daughter in episode 2250. We also learn that Ryan and Abby are both the same age (2249), and Abby gave birth to Lia, who is now 3 (2241, 2243, 2248, 2256), when she (2241, 2243, 2249) and Ryan (2241, 2242, 2243) were both 16 - or, according to Katie, Ryan was 17 (2246) - after becoming pregnant by him four years ago (2242).

It is Kelly's birthday in episode 2239, on Saturday; it is Kylie's seventh birthday, which is "tomorrow" in episode 2267, in episode 2268; and it is the 18th birthday of Leo, who is "almost 18" in episode 2267 and "18 this week" in episode 2269, in episode 2270. He is still 18 in episodes 2272 and 2281. Greg's coffin plate, seen in episode 2273, reveals that he was 42 when he died on 27th August 1999, which meant he was younger than Jimmy (2274); and we are told that Sandra is in her late 30's (2233), Luke turned 21 while on remand (2236), Susannah is "on the wrong side of 35" (2240), Josh was born nearly 6 years ago (2245), Victoria is "20-something" (2254), Kelly and Emily are both under 16 (2254), Jason and Little Jimmy died at the same age (2261), and Jason wasn't much older than Leo (2273); Nikki is 19 (2273), and Jacqui is a year older than Katie (2282).

Marriages:

One - Ronald William Dixon marries Anthea Sarah Brindley in episode 2237. It is one year since Susannah remarried Max in episode 2240; and we are told that Nathan "served" five years with the unseen Sarah (2235), and that Greg and Margi have been married "over 20 years" (2240) / "over 20-odd years" (2244) / "23 years" (2258).

Deaths:

Three - Greg Shadwick dies aged 42 on 27th August 1999 in episode 2259, a victim of the "Millennium Club" explosion; Jason Shadwick is also a victim of the same explosion in episode 2260; and Victor the Vicar is the victim of a gangland assassination in episode 2268. Based on dialogue in episodes 2261, 2264 and 2267, and a newspaper headline seen in episode 2261, it would seem that there was also a third fatality in the explosion - an un-named, unseen character. Other unseen but named dead characters are Mrs Irene Jones, a cleaner who was thought to have succumbed to food poisoning (2237), but the cause of whose death is later revealed to be peritonitis (2241); Jerome's father (2237, 2255, 2256, 2265, 2274, 2275, 2276); Greg's father (2239, 2258) / Tommy, Jessie's husband (2264); Tony, Jessie's true love, killed in Suez (2258); Jessie's mother, who lived through the Blitz (2261); Emily's Grandad Benson, whose cremation she remembers going to (2265); and Duncan, the father of Callum and Alasdair, who died on a November morning (2269).

Toilet visits:

Ryan (2234); Jason (2234); Margi (2234); Jimmy (2236 - three times. He has the "trots"); Ron (2237 - three times. He "keeps going" too); Rachel (2237 - twice); Nikki (2240 - twice, and 2265, "again"); Tim (2241 and 2250); Greg (2241); Susannah (2241); Mr Moore (2242); Katrina (2266); two unnamed ladies (2266); Jacqui (2271); Lindsey (2271); Sinbad (2271) and Megan (2271).

Mentioned, so far unseen, but bound to turn up later:

Nathan's brother (2251, 2261) / elder brother (2272); Susannah's mother (2262, 2271) - an alcoholic chain-smoker, not to be trusted (2271); Katrina's mother (2264, 2265, 2270 - and she is also mentioned in a note Katrina has written to Susannah in episode 2241); Katrina's father (2264, 2270); and Ian Leigh, a developer (2281).

Goofs:

In episode 2236, an unseen usher is heard referring to the case of The Crown and "MusgroveS"; at one point in episode 2240, Jerome describes the job for which he and Nikki are both being interviewed as a leisure "attendant" instead of "assistant"; and Jason's thirteenth and fourteenth words are in the wrong order in episode 2243: "Some clown's got hold of a load of them and stuck them ALL UP over Manor Park.".

In episode 2247, when she and Lindsey find the letters N and G on a wall after stripping off wallpaper, Jackie talks about several former inhabitants of number 9, including those that she has never met. "There was a young couple who lived here - aw, she died. I think it was a wiring accident". Jonathan had concealed that element of Laura's death from everyone except Terry, who was sworn to secrecy - so there is surely no way that Jackie, not even around at the time, should have known that!! "But their name didn't begin with a G.". Well, actually it did - Gordon-Davies. "It can't be the Harrisons, who lived here for a few years.". No, they didn't - they came and went within just a year!

Rachel either replaces "in for" with "into", or a "g" with an "l", in episode 2249: "As long as you know what you're letting yourself into.", and Katie is similarly torn between "nice long" and "longer" in episode 2251: "I can have a nice longer lunch hour.". Anthea adds an "s" to her last word in episode 2252: "They've got it all under controls.", and Luke omits one from his fourth word in episode 2256: "As far as everyone' concerned, I'm a sex offender.". And, after dialling "1471" in episode 2261, Jackie is unrealistically quick in hearing the previous caller's number, the option to redial it by pressing "3", and Karen's answerphone, to which she is transferred!

Niamh refers twice in episode 2270 to "Alec", when speaking to Jackie - "We're meeting Alec and the kids out there." - and Joey - "It was good of Alec to take the kids into town, wasn't it?". Surely she should have called him "Dad" ? And Margi's fourth, fifth and sixth words shuffle around in episode 2282: "How can I think of even going away and leaving you behind?".

Trivia:

Nathan went to Liverpool University (2272), and Darren has known - and fancied! - Victoria for nine years since they started at university (2256). Victoria and Mark's house is in Didsbury (2253), and Charlotte is a physio attached to Darren's practice (2281). Mr Moore is teetotal (2241), a committed Christian (2252), a hospital visitor (2283), and an assistant percussionist in a Salvation Army band (2250). He has supported the fayre at the "General" hospital (2247) for 20 years (2244), and follows the "Warrington Wolves" rugby league team (2250), as well as Wrexham FC (2238). The establishment he finds to be responsible for the food poisoning is the "Banger Heaven Hot Dog Stand", on the corner of Pilgrim Avenue and Mafeking Road (2244).

Josh has been working in London for the last three years, and the last time he saw Jason was when they worked together at Anfield four years ago (2257). Jason is doing a job in Digmore Street (2237), and his funeral takes place at 12.00 at South Sefton Crematorium (2261). Greg has left his van in Feltham Way, which is 100 yards through the woods (2238). Leo is seen looking at a copy of "Racer" magazine, which is Jason's (2253), according to Nikki, whose full name is Nicola Jessica Shadwick (2233). She receives a letter from Liverpool John Moores University, Roscoe Court, 4 Rodney Street, Liverpool L1 1TZ, showing its telephone numbers as 0151 231 5090 / 5091 and the fax number 0151 231 3194, expressing condolences on her recent losses and asking her to advise whether she intends to return in time for the second semester, which begins on Tuesday 18th January 2000 (2275).

The headline in the "Echo" which Jimmy is seen reading in episode 2261 is "THREE DIE IN NIGHTCLUB BLAST", and one of a pile of rejection letters he shows to Jackie is from "Bridus Security" (2281). She follows him to "The Village Inn", where he is having a drink with Karen (2262), whose father was a railway steward, and whose mother worked in a supermarket (2263). To gain access to Alec George, Lindsey poses as a representative of "Nu-Form Floor Coverings" (2251). The tax disc on Jerome's car, seen in episode 2247, expires at the end of March 2000; and Ryan is still driving taxi number 3024 (2247) from "Goldline Taxis", bearing the telephone number 0151-269-9696 (2249, 2279). When he was young, he used to do impressions of Frank Spencer (2268). Abby left home at the age of 15 (2248), and met Ryan in Rhodes when they were both 16 (2241).......see "Births" !

The telephone number 0151 269 5941 is seen again on Greg's van in episodes 2243, 2245, 2251, 2255 and 2256. His credit card number begins with 3546 (2242), and the flowers for Susannah which he orders with it are delivered in a van bearing the logo "Immortelle Florist" and an 0151 telephone number (2246). Flowers sent to Lindsey by Shelley, Rose's interior designer (2250), arrive in a van with the same logo - quite possibly the same van! - in episode 2262. The telephone number 0151 269 5341 is seen again on the "Great Grannies Agency" shop sign in episode 2258; and Ron is seen with a file marked with the name "ARROWSMITH" - presumably a "Great Grannies" customer - in episode 2276.

In his "A" levels Matt gets two Cs and a D (2256). He and Bosko want to get stones from "Addison's Yard" (2243). Callum, who would rather be listening to music by "Belle and Sebastian" than talking to Alasdair (2262), spent time in Borstal (2268); Susannah is in ward 3X (2271); and Rachel has been shopping at Sainsbury's (2249). There is a George Clooney poster on the wall of one of the girls' rooms in the bungalow (2271); art by Ansel Adams (2251, 2252) and Claude Monet (2252) still hangs in the solicitors' office; and art by Robert Delaunay is still on Susannah's wall (2255). Mr Moore (2238, 2241, 2242), Jackie (2251, 2264), Susannah (2258), Jacqui (2264), Mick (2264), Lindsey (2264), Ron (2267, 2268, 2276), and Margi (2269) are all right-handed, while Jimmy (2265) and Mike (2268, 2280) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Episode 2254 is the only one during which, for no obvious or explained reason, Emily is wearing glasses.

Katie's words in the original broadcast of episode 2282, "All the time he was shagging Susannah behind her back." are changed in the Saturday teatime omnibus repeat, in which a different recording of the same scene is used: "All the time he was doing it with Susannah behind her back.".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

After he has accidentally knocked out of her hand a bottle she has just bought at the garage shop, Margi launches into an attack on Luke, blaming him for Nikki being an absolute wreck, coming home in such a state that she can't even stand up. She tells Katie that she should realise he is likely to drug and rape her too, and says Luke's parents must be stupid if they think he is innocent. Luke angrily tells Margi to leave his parents out of it, and suggests that Nikki might be drinking because she has just lost her brother and father. Margi accuses him of making the last year of their lives an absolute misery - and he asks her if that explains why Greg was so quick to jump into bed with Susannah.......
