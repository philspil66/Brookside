In episode 96 the action continues AFTER the end credits, but before the "Mersey Television Production" caption - Bobby and Sheila are seen collapsing into bed, drunk and laughing, after celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. This episode, running to just under 26 minutes, is the longest so far, and features an unprecedentedly high number of credited performers - thirty-two. In the whole 21 years of the series, this total would only once be exceeded.......

The credits continue to be displayed on a light blue background until episode 104. Thereafter they are superimposed over an image of the Close.

For scheduling reasons, episodes 105 and 106 were broadcast edited together as an artificial double episode - a practice which would become all too frequent many years later.

The storylines:

While there is also much light relief in this season, life on the Close continues to be fairly tough for the residents. Paul is not enjoying his new job, and is concerned about Gordon's choice of friends. Alan and Samantha decide to marry, but after he has said his vows she decides not to go through with it after all. Despite the efforts of Sheila and the other wives, Fairbanks Engineering is closed down, so Bobby is out of work. Sydney's attempts to reconcile Roger and Heather are unsuccessful, and Petra commits suicide. Marie and George, who have been living temporarily with Michelle while their own place is refurbished, decide to move in permanently - and there are also new arrivals at number 7, Harry and Edna Cross. Before too long, it is clear that Harry is unaware of his son's living arrangements, and that Edna may have a gambling problem....

The dates:

It is reasonable to suppose that most scenes are set on approximately the dates on which the episodes were originally aired. In episode 105, Halloween is "tomorrow"; in episode 115 it is "nearly Christmas", and in episode 122 it is New Year's Eve. There are only occasional more specific references that it is Saturday (110, 113), Sunday (114, 118 ); and Tuesday (111).


Name-checks:

Paul McCartney (95); Lord Derby - who George once rescued, according to the twins (95); Barry Manilow (95); Norman Tebbit (97); Stanley Matthews (98 ); Tex Ritter (98 ): Joan of Arc (99); Arthur Scargill (101); "Mr Rickenbacker" from a jeans commercial (102); "That's Life" (105); Fanny and Johnnie, chefs (106); Dead Or Alive, Echo and the Bunnymen, Wah! (107); John Peel (109); James Dean (110); Stanley Woods, TT champion (114); Nat King Cole (122); Lonnie Donegan (122); The Muppets (129); Tracey Ullman (129); Liv Ullmann (129); Scott (of the) Antarctic (132).

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in Liverpool, except that several scenes in episodes 99 and 100 take place in Belfast, where Heather visits her parents.

Births:

None. We are told, however, that the Jackson twins are 10 (105); Karen is still 16 (112); Gordon is 15 (113); and Bobby is 46 (131). Although it has previously been mentioned that Sheila is older than Bobby, unfortunately in episode 101 it is Sheila's 43rd birthday....... Beginning a long tradition of people's ages being incorrect whenever they appear in the press, Sheila's is given as "53" in the newspaper in episode 102. In the same paper, Samantha's age is "29" - which may or may not be correct. In episode 127, Alan's mother reminds him of a promise he made in 1954 when he was 7; and, according to Lucy, Mme Dubois is about the same age as Annabelle (121).


Marriages:

None. Samantha decides against marrying Alan at an uncomfortably late moment in episode 129. In episode 99, however, we are told that Heather and Roger have been married "just over a year", and that George and Marie have been married for 15 years.


Deaths:

One - Petra Taylor commits suicide in Llandudno (episode 130). We are also told that the following unseen and never-to-be-seen characters are no longer alive: Jack Turner's brother, who used to work for Standard Triumph (97); Marie's mother (103); Terry's grandad (104); Edna's mother (127); Alan's uncle Arthur (127); and Cyril, Alan's father, who died nearly ten years ago of a heart attack at the age of 48 (128 ). And, some time after the event, we finally learn that Gavin was 24 when he died (128 ).


Toilet visits:

Only two - Terry in episode 105, and Barry in episode 121 (after conning Karen out of the bathroom!)

In episode 105, Barry's mate, who telephones him in need of cable is Bert; but in episode 107 Terry calls him Fred....
In episode 130, Harry appears to know the barmaid and calls her Pauline, but George calls her "Louie" (perhaps meant to be "Lovie"?).

"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

Without being named or having any dialogue, Val's uncle is seen in episode 97.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Late at night, Barry and Terry carry Alan home from the pub, where they have been teasing him about being a mummy's boy. When his mother opens the bungalow door, he drunkenly wishes her a happy (Chinese) New Year, and tells her he wants her to leave: "I'm fed up with you mothercoddling me, Molly". Molly, who has already decided to go, says she hopes he chokes on his MUESLI (which she has finally learned to pronounce), and drives away. The lads' celebratory singing wakens
Sheila, who opens her bedroom window and orders Barry in - meekly, he obeys. Alan continues to drunkenly sing outside the bungalow, until he complies when Sheila orders him to go inside too....
