"Flashbacks" to other sequences from earlier episodes continue to appear frequently in this season, In the cast list above, * denotes that the character appears (or is heard) only within one or more such sequences, and does not otherwise feature in the episode.

These episodes were not shown individually on Channel Four, but only as omnibus editions on Saturday afternoons, typically at 4.00pm - and efforts began to be made to concentrate primarily on just one major storyline across each of the three episodes within each omnibus edition. Apart from the omnibus on Saturday 22nd February 2003 (to which a sequence of reprises was added AFTER the opening titles sequence), the omnibus editions shown from Saturday 1st February 2003 onwards had added pre-credits sequences, mainly featuring extracts from past episodes of the characters who would be dominating the omnibus which followed. However, Adele Murray and the Clerk of Courts (2799) / Ali Gordon and Dr Mittal (2802) / Terry "Psycho" Gibson, Anthony Murray, and Laura Stevens (2808) / Dan Morrisey (2820) were featured within a pre-credits sequence without then appearing in the episode to which it was attached.

"Teardrop" by "Massive Attack" is the soundtrack to Anthony's nightmare at the beginning of episode 2798; and more than 90 seconds of "Come Away With Me" by Norah Jones is played following the death of Emily in episode 2801, accompanying scenes of her with Tim and others. "Whole Again" by "Atomic Kitten" is played by Tim, and can also be heard during scenes in other households, at the beginning of episode 2805; and "Magic Moments" by Perry Como is played in the background of several consecutive scenes in different locations, but mainly those involving Bev and Josh in the bathroom, in episode 2813. "You're The Best Thing" by "The Style Council" is heard in the background of a montage of scenes of Gabby after Gary has left her alone in their flat in episode 2814; and other incidental music is briefly used in places in episodes 2794, 2795, 2798 and 2801.

During episode 2794, we briefly hear the voices of the characters at the dinner party as we see Nisha elsewhere, and we briefly hear the voices of Marty and Adele at home as we see Anthony being shown round the courtroom. On two occasions during episode 2810, we briefly hear the voice of Marty as we see Gabby and Gary, then Ron, Mike and Beth. At various points during episode 2815, we briefly hear the voices of Bev, then Gabby and Gary, then Dan and Luke, as we see images of Mike, Rachel and Beth. Episode 2818 begins with Luke reading a poem, as we see images of the Gordons in various different places. During episode 2820, we briefly hear the voices of Rachel and Katie as we see images of Mike, and we hear the voices of Bev and Ron as we see images of Jacqui and Max; and during episode 2825, we again briefly hear the voices of Bev and Ron as we see various cross-faded scenes of Jacqui and Max, looking around a new house. Ron's early scenes alone in episode 2823 are also seen as a series of cross-fades.

At the beginning of episode 2798, Anthony is seen having a nightmare in which he is found guilty in court, involving various characters who are all seen later on in the episode; during episode 2809, Adele is very briefly seen dreaming of herself and Tim; and episode 2820 begins with a much longer daydream that Rachel is having - in which she, Mike and Beth are rich, and employ Jacqui as their down-trodden nanny, Max as their toadying servant, and Ron as their obliging chauffeur. Although the others all make physical appearances later on in this episode, Ron does not.

The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard quietly in the background at the Farnhams' in episode 2823, when Harry and Emma, out-of-vision, are presumably watching in another room.

The storylines:

Anthony starts at a new school, after being cleared of Imelda's murder - and so does Josh, after he proves too much for his present one (and, at times, Bev!) to cope with. Jan manages to persuade Adele to accept that she is moving back in with Marty, and Nikki manages to persuade Jimmy not only to let her move back in with him, but also to sleep with her. Tim also finds time to sleep with a couple of keen young ladies, but Steve only just about manages to ask Kirsty out, as the lads plan their revenge on Terry - after Emily joins Diane in that great hair salon in the sky. And it also finally emerges that Alan Gordon has well and truly puffed his last crafty cigarette.

There are other departures too - Dan is sent packing by Ruth, when he proves to be a much worse father for Luke than Sean could ever have been, and Nisha also leaves to pursue a career (and, presumably, attached men) elsewhere. Gabby and Gary, with a baby on the way, resolve to rebuild their marriage, and Katie continues to look forward to giving birth, with the support of boyfriend Nic. Rachel discovers that she too is pregnant - just after she and Mike misguidedly move away to a bigger and better house than they can afford, and are disowned by Ron when Rachel tries to help herself cope with their financial burdens by helping herself to some of Max and Jacqui's money. But surely Max and Jacqui aren't also about to leave the Close for pastures new? Well, not if Ron has anything to do with it.....

The dates:

Although we are reminded during Anthony's trial of when various previously-seen events occurred - the death of Imelda was on 20th March (2795, 2796), and March 29th was "10 days later" [depending when you start counting!!] (2796); Anthony ran out of church on Easter Sunday (2797), and his attack involving a waste-paper basket was on April 10th (2797) - there are very few clear indications of the dates on which any of the current episodes are set. We are only told that it is Sunday in episode 2815; it is Sunday again - and Mother's Day - in episode 2820 (but see "Goofs" below!); it is "nearly Spring" in episode 2821; and 2005 is "a long way off" in episode 2822. However, it is probably 14th February in episode 2803, as Josh gives Bev a Velentine card; and it is probably a Thursday in episode 2800, as the wheelie bins are out for the binmen!

Name-checks:

Jamie Oliver (2798); Robbie Williams (2798); Tony Soprano (2798); "Geoff" [Hurst, expression] (2798); "Sleeping Beauty" (2801, 2802); "Columbo" (2804); "Atomic Kitten" (2805); Liberace (2805); Jack Jones [expression] (2805); Britney [Spears] (2805); W.

Bev is alluding to "Attila the Hun" when she refers to Ron as "Attila the Grandad" in episode 2812.

Locations:

The majority of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, although there are Manchester-based scenes in episodes 2803, 2804, 2824 and 2825 - in and around the pub "The Angel" and the nightclub "Milan" in episode 2804, and in and near Jenny's home in the others; and Marty and Steve are briefly seen in Leeds in episode 2810. However, none of these scenes were necessarily recorded at these locations.

Births:

None, although Gabby and Katie are both still pregnant throughout the season - and in episode 2819 Rachel reveals that she now is as well. In episode 2821, Katie is "six months" pregnant. According to Christy, Jan had three kids by the time she was 25 (2810); and Adele recalls Jan packing and leaving when she was 7 (2810). Adele studies horoscopes for herself and Tim - Virgo and Aquarius respectively - in episode 2806.

Imelda was 12 (2794); Jacqui is over 18 (2798) / 26 (2825); Anthony was 12 [when he killed Imelda] (2798) / is 13 (2799); Emily was 20 when she died (2802); Jimmy is over 50, and will be 60 when Nikki is 30-ish (2806); Adele is nearly 18 (2808) / 17 (2809); Josh is 10 (2810); Ali is 16, and nearly 17 (2817); Mike and Rachel are in their "mid/late 20s", according to Max (2822); Ron thinks that Max will be over 50 in 2005 (2822), but Max reminds Jacqui that he will be 50 in five years' time (2823): and Bev is "pushing 31", again according to Ron (2823).

Marriages:

None - and there are absolutely no indications during any of these episodes as to how long any of the couples featured or mentioned have been married, or when any of them got married.

Deaths:

Two: Emily O'Leary never awakens from her coma, and dies in episode 2801, at the age of 20 (2802). She has been dead for just over a week in episode 2806, and it is a week after her funeral in episode 2807. Then, in episode 2817, news of Alan Gordon is brought to Ali - and in episode 2818 we discover that it is that he has been found dead, in a quarry (2818, 2821) in Barnsley (2821). As episode 2819 begins, the family have been to his cremation.

We are reminded that Imelda was 12 (2794) when she died on 20th March (2796); and two unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters are mentioned - Sean's father (2793), and "Mr Swingwer", who a radio newsreader mentions lay dead for three weeks before a neighbour noticed his junk mail piling up (2823).

Toilet visits:

Marty (2795); Kenny (2796); an unnamed man (2796); Jimmy (2798); Tim (2801); Mozza (2804, although maybe only for somewhere quiet to do his crossword); Ron (2811); Mike (2816); Luke (2817 - wetting himself, and he has also wet the bed); Ali (2817); and Luke (2819, having wet the bed again).

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Jennifer, and either Paul or Adrian - two of Gary's partners in the medical practice (2814).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Goofs:

In episode 2793, Nisha omits the word "more" between "her" and "by" in episode 2793 - "More so than being stuck in a loveless marriage with you hating her by the day."; and, in the same episode, Ruth says "tying down a job" instead of "trying to hold down a job".

In episode 2800, Marty garbles a line by adding an unnecessary "go and" - "Jan thinks that maybe going to go and stay with her might take the pressure off him for a bit."; and in episode 2807, one of Laura's lines is even more garbled: "I remember when my nan was in - I was chocka.". What?

In episode 2808, Bev's line "I'll bring him round for about an hour or two" comes out as "I'll bring him about round an hour or two."; and in episode 2817, Ruth changes the meaning of a line by adding a "was": "I was meant to tell you last night.".

References to "Mother's Day" in episode 2820 imply that it is then Sunday, 30th March 2003. However, in episode 2822, "a whole week" has elapsed since Rachel did not fully pay the takings into Max's account, but the up-to-date online statement Max is seen examining in that episode is dated 28/03/03.

Trivia:

Mike needs to find "Burdock Street" (2821) in his taxi, which bears the name "County Cars" and the telephone number 0151 496 2222 (2821, 2822). He and Rachel now live at 43 Cherrydale Road, Liverpool - and the reference number with which she thinks she has won a prize is RD87913 (2822). Max uses the firm he worked for many years earlier, "Fletcher's", as his estate agents - the telephone number appearing on their "For Sale" sign is still 0151 629 1876 (2823, 2824). The estate agents selling the house he and Jacqui want to buy - "The Meadows", Park Lane, Woolton - are "Jones, Thomas and Booth" (2824, 2825). Its asking price is £345,000 - and Ron offers £360,000 (2824, 2825), so Max offers £375,000 (2825).

When she was younger, Jacqui hated black pudding (2794); and Gary originally proposed to Gabby on receipt number BD012993 from the cab company "Websters Taxis", telephone number 0151 296 6725, which she has kept (2814). The first song they danced to at their wedding reception was "You're The Best Thing" by "The Style Council" (2814). Alan's favourite Bruce Springsteen song, which he had joked he wanted to be played at his funeral, was "I'm On Fire" (2818); while, according to Tim, "Whole Again" by "Atomic Kitten" was one of the favourites (2805) of his late wife, formerly Emily Margaret Shadwick (2802).

The new school Anthony David Murray (2795) plans to attend is "Broadhurst Comp"[rehensive], which Laura's cousin goes to (2805). Imelda was temporarily excluded from St Agnes's Roman Catholic Primary School for bullying at the age of 8 (2796); Lance used to be "dead good" at Chemistry (2812); and the essay Nikki is writing for her university course, which Jimmy has second thoughts about trying to help her with, is "Perception and Language Ability in the Rhesus Monkey" (2798). There are still Kate Bush posters on Adele's bedroom wall (2805); and Tim (2793), Nikki (2797, 2805), Gabby (2799), Max (2799, 2822), John (2800), Ron (2809, 2825), a nurse (2810), and Luke (2818) are all right-handed, whereas Mike is left-handed (2819).

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Ron and Jacqui sit in the front garden of the house in which they have both lived for much of the last decade and a half - and, having recalled some of the early highlights of their time there, Jacqui reminds her father that when she and Max move, she will only be a few miles away - and much nearer whenever she is at work. And he has still got Bev close by anyway. She assures him that they will always be there for each other - and, no matter how far apart they may be in the future, she will always remember everything he has taught her about people, and life, and families, and fighting and loving each other, and standing by each other, and standing by what they believe in. "All these things are inside me. And while they're inside me, you'll never be far away.".

Virtually all the other storylines of recent weeks had also reached very satisfactory conclusions - the only real exception being Tim and Steve's ongoing quest to find Terry - so the removal or reworking of the few scenes involving Steve, Tim and Jenny from the last three episodes, and perhaps a longer, lingering final shot of Jacqui and Ron hugging in front of their former home, and/or a pan out to the whole of the Close at the end of its already magnificent closing scene, could have turned episode 2825 into just about as good a "final" episode of "Brookside" as anyone could have hoped for.

But there would be two seasons more.......
