The closing credits continue to be superimposed over a view of the close, except that in episode 155 - uniquely! - the action continues all the way through to the "Mersey Television Production" caption - Alan Partridge bashes his head repeatedly on the road, until his horrible friend Liz takes him into the house. The fade into the closing credits of episode 179 is from a freeze-frame of Karen and Andrew, aboard the motorcycle which has just knocked Sheila down, and is accompanied by an echoing scream.

Among the performers playing the smaller roles, there are several interesting names. John McArdle and Justine Kerrigan would later play Billy and Tracey Corkhill, and Damon wouldn't even notice that these new neighbours looked remarkably like his former teacher and schoolmate.......John Burgess, later to play David Crosbie, is the private school headmaster who wisely turns down the chance of educating the Jackson twins.......and Annette Ekblom, who would play Debbie Gordon in the closing years of the series, is young businesswoman Celia Thompson. There are also one-off roles for Adrian Mills (of "That's Life") as a footballer, Jan Harvey (Howards' Way) as an accountant, and veteran comedian Chic Murray as Paul's tailor.

Roger Phillips becomes the second credited performer in a different role - although having previously been seen as Petra's boss Dave Simpson, this time he is only heard as a radio newsreader. Several more voice-overs would follow, and eventually he would also appear again in the series.......playing himself!!

Previously credited only as "Terry", Brian Regan's character finally gains the surname "Sullivan" from episode 133 onwards.

The storylines:

For some of the residents this is ultimately a positive time, even though some obstacles have to be dealt with first. The Jacksons and Michelle face the unwelcome return of their long-lost father, but then discover that Petra has left her money to them and not him, and consider how best to make use of it. Alan turns to drink, faces depression, and forms a misguided friendship, but is finally reunited with his true love. While Annabelle briefly goes home to her mother's when Paul isn't spending enough time with her, they too are reunited, and Paul finds a new role at PetroChem in which he is much happier. Heather takes the next step in her promising career, by moving to join one of the largest accountancy firms. Meanwhile, Harry stubbornly refuses to accept that Kevin is "living in sin", has an angina attack, and is concerned that Edna is gambling again; and, following Bobby's redundancy, Sheila runs an employment agency, which unfortunately results in the DHSS taking Matty to court. She is also shocked, firstly, to discover that, in her early forties, she is pregnant again, and, secondly, to find herself right in the path of a fast-moving motorbike.......


The dates:

It is reasonable to suppose that most scenes are set on approximately the dates on which the episodes were originally aired. In some instances, there is no doubt - it is Valentine's Day in episode 135, February 29th in episode 140, Shrove Tuesday, March 6th, in episode 141, Mother's Day, Sunday April 1st in episode 148, and April 10th in episode 151. In episode 144, aired in the middle of March, Paul brings "pre-budget" wine to Robin's dinner party, after Annabelle jokes that it should really be shamrock wine. There are occasional other references that it is Saturday (145), Grand National Saturday (147), Easter Sunday (154), Cup Final day (162), the year of "Big Brother" (163); 1984 (166); and the 10th (177).

Name-checks:

Vernon Scammell, a poet Harry has never heard of (134); Paul Getty (139); Maggie / Thatcher (141, 143, 153); [Ronald] Reagan (143); Hitler (143); Gandhi (144); "Mastermind" (146, 170); Dick Turpin (146); various characters from "Star Wars" (149); Sir Alfred McAlpine (150); Barry Manilow (150); "Grandstand" (153, 168 ); David and Goliath (155); "Rumpole Of The Bailey" (156); "The Birdman Of Alcatraz" (161); John Wayne (164); "Blazing Saddles" (169, 170), Mel Brooks (169); Mother Teresa (170); Christopher Columbus (171); Sir Francis Drake (171); Davy Crockett (171); Carlton Magee (171, 172); Bo Derek (172); [Arthur] Scargill (173); Arthur Negus (175); Saatchi and Saatchi (177); Vesteys (millionaires) (177); Percy Thrower (178 ), "Little Lord Fauntleroy" (178 ). Damon sarcastically refers to "Charlie" in episode 161; from the context, it is clear that he is referring to Prince Charles.

(What do you mean, you've never heard of Carlton Magee??)

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in Liverpool, except that several scenes in episodes 167 and 168 take place in Spain, where Bobby and Sheila are on holiday, and Doreen and Ken are picking these things up as they go along.

Births:

None. Sheila claims that Damon is already 16 when confronting Mr Todd in episode 137, but we are then told that he is 16 (or 4!) on 29th February 1984, so he was definitely born on 29th February 1968 (140, 155). Jessica is 14 (134), Sheila is still 43 (138, 163), In episode 144 the twins are still 10, and Bobby is still 46; however, Karen is now 17 and Gordon is 15. Since these characters were previously revealed to have the same birthday, with Karen a year older than Gordon, it's difficult to see how she extended her lead.......She is still 17 in episode 180. It appears that Bobby has recently had a birthday, which Barry forgot, in episode 148. The twins are still "about 10", according to Annabelle, in episode 152. According to Will, Rose is "teenage" (163). Ken and Doreen have children aged 19 and 23 (167), including Anita (168 ). Barry's 25th birthday was "yesterday" in episode 167. Marie was born in the Dingles (178 ).

Marriages:

At last, the first "Brookside" wedding takes place in episode 179. as Cyril Alan Partridge and Samantha Helen Davis are hitched at the second attempt (and by the same registrar as the first time!!). In episode 177, Edna reminds Harry that they have been married for 40 years; she may, of course, just be rounding to the nearest 10 years.......

Deaths:

None. We are told, however, of the deaths of unseen and never-to-be-seen characters Scunner Jones, a mate of Bobby and Matty, who was killed by a bus while jogging (138), and Marie's mother, who died when she was 14 (139). And, on this topic, the following cautionary tale from episode 162 surely merits a special mention:

Quote:
HARRY: Years ago, when I worked in the shed in Edge Hall, a mate of mine came in one morning. And the foreman said to him, "You're looking very worried, Fred. What's the matter?". He said, "It's my uncle. He's terribly ill.". And this foreman said, "It's all in his mind. He only THINKS he's ill. And you tell him when you go home tonight.".......Next morning, he comes in to work, and his foreman says to him, "Well, how's your uncle this morning, Fred?". Fred said, "He thinks he's dead.".

EDNA: Well, was he?

Toilet visits:

Only two - Davey Jones in episode 143, and George Jackson in episode 170.

Characters not seen yet, but there's just a chance that they may be coming along later:

Annabelle's mother (157, 161, 172); and Timmy, who got Rose pregnant (163, 164, 166, 179)

Gone but not forgotten - those seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Goofs:

In episode 149, one of the Jackson twins says "C P 3 O" instead of "C 3 P O"; and in episode 159, Edna mispronounces "coronary".


Trivia:

Paul is right-handed (174). His former job title at PetroChem was Production Manager (144). Dorothy Tate worked there for five years (151), starting in the typing pool and rising to secretary to Barry Potter - now she is a headmistress (144) of a primary school (165). Nigel Bannister has worked at PetroChem for 22 years (170).

Gordon goes to Park Royal School, where he is taking two 'O' levels a year early - Maths and Computer Studies (171). While working on Alan's computer, Gordon takes a telephone message for Alan to call someone back on 267981 (which should perhaps have been a seven-digit number?) (143).

Twenty years ago, Edna and Harry were in debt, until they were rescued by "The Laird".......a horse ridden by J. King at 12/1 (179). Sally and Jessica have lived with Kevin for three months (140). Jessica is one of his pupils (133).

Linda was in the year above Damon at school, and, according to Karen, is an only child (162). Tommy McArdle's star sign is Virgo (145). Matty has worked since he was 15 (138 ). His full name is Matthew Arthur Nolan (150). Eddie Cunningham was made redundant a month ago. The football club he used to play for is Newtown (146)

Heather prepares for an interview at Hamilton & Devereux in episode 134. We don't discover until much later that her interviewer there is Keith Tench, but we do learn that he isn't married (135). She was one of 36 applicants, and refused to be tempted to stay at JD Hargreaves by being offered James Haulage and Harrisons, a chain of butchers, as clients (136). Her junior as Hamilton & Devereux, Greg, has a sister, a nephew and a younger niece (160). Derek Hobbs' new firm is "Hobbs, Hall and Wallace" in episode 160.......so there must have been some renegotiation since episode 75, when it was going to be called "Wallace, Hall & Hobbs".

George went to Pitfield Secondary School (171). Marie's former address was 169 Brooklands South, and her late sister's full name was Mrs Petra Mary Taylor nee Jones (145). The school she fails to enrol the twins in is Langley Hall (171, 172, 178 ).

Alan Partridge is left-handed (154). His telephone number is still 2599232 (160). The estate agents he uses to sell the bungalow are the same ones that Heather is using (173) - Menskip Pearse, whose telephone number is 2599271 (178 ). The sign is installed by Normington Signs, Northwich, telephone number 0606 484312 (177). Before leaving for the Gulf, Alan sells his computer to a place in Widnes called Barclay's (180).

The honours board at "The Swan" prominently lists J.E. Balfour as Club Captain and J. Robinson as Secretary (152).

A "Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

Episode 147 offers viewers the opportunity to spot that Barry has not made quite the deal he thought he had, some time before he comes to realise it himself. Although he has said he is picking up video recorders, the box we see him loading into the boot of his car is marked "video disc player".......

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

A sombre end to an above-average season, as the closing music fades up, and Bobby's voice fades down, while the camera pans away from the couple, through the hospital ward and into the corridor outside, as Bobby begins to patiently explain to Sheila what the doctor has told him following her accident: "He did say I'm going to be all right, didn't he?"; "Yeah, yeah, there's just one problem, love. He wants you to have this test done. Because you were bleeding so much, if they do the test now, it could cause a miscarriage. And if they don't do the test, Sheila......."
