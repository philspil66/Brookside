The storylines:

After helping him out, Carl sets up in competition with Sinbad as a window cleaner, while Jean becomes determined to run a better social club than her rival Audrey. She and David begin to patch up their differences when Patricia gives birth to a Down's Syndrome baby, Alice - but Max finds it difficult to become involved with caring for his new daughter, and busies himself preparing for the opening of a new restaurant instead. Preparations also continue for Mick and Marianne's wedding, and for convenience they go on their honeymoon first. Jimmy is released from prison, and so is Garry's father Greg, but neither of them appear convinced that acting outside the law isn't still the best way forward. After he and Terry both survive the explosion, Simon is granted bail and starts to make his presence felt on the parade, working from a base in the "wilderness" (the woods). Meanwhile, Rachel joins a boys' football team, Eddie loses the role of shop steward, and Sarah goes back home to her mother, while Penny begins to wonder if she would like to become one by having a child with Barry. It emerges that Bev has lied about who she had a child with, and Jacqui moves out into a flat with Katie as Ron returns to DD, who wants to have their marriage vows renewed. But she doesn't know that she is Josh's grandmother, or whether Ron is entirely convinced thst he really wants to be with her rather than Bev.......

Locations:

While most of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, there are scenes in episode 1466 set on a coach going to, and back from, Blackpool when it is an unspecified distance between these locations. Otherwise, the furthest afield that any of the characters are seen is the "Hogfest" in Ainsdale, near Southport, in episode 1460 - actually recorded in Childwall - and New Brighton, in episode 1462.

Births:

One - Patricia's baby, Alice, is due on 19th August, which is "in a few weeks' time" (1444) / "in two weeks" (1446) / "next week" (1450), and is born in episode 1451. It is Beth's 19th birthday in episode 1450, which is "next week" in episode 1448 and "on Wednesday" in episode 1449; it is the unseen Kerry Willis's birthday this week in episode 1443; it is the seventh birthday of someone's "little brother, Henry" in episode 1448; and it is Leo's birthday in episode 1465. According the the sign above his hospital bed, Terry's date of birth is 2/11/60 (1441); and we are also told that Carl is 21 (1443), Jacqui is 18 (1445, 1446, 1468), Bev is half Jackie's age, according to Jimmy (1445), Rebecca is 3 (1445), Lee is 14 (1449), Garry is 16 (1466), and Steven is 2 (1471).

Marriages:

None. In episode 1446 it is the 22nd wedding anniversary "this week" of Ron and DD, who were together for 20 years (1462), and they make a booking to renew their marriage vows "next Wednesday" (1474). We are also told that PC Coban is married (1440); Don is divorced (1441); Friday 15th August would have been Sue and Terry's 5th wedding anniversary (1443); Marianne and Mick plan to marry in November (1451), which is two months' away (1459) / next month (1472); and Ray's parents have had their golden wedding (1465).

Deaths:

One - Jimmy discovers his cell-mate Don McAteer dead of a drug overdose in episode 1447. Jean assures David that he was not correct when he told Mr Brennan that she died in 1963, on the same day that Kennedy was assassinated (1455); and in episode 1471 it is three years since the deaths of Terry's wife and son.

Toilet visits:

Many! There's Rebecca (1442); Rosie (1442); David (1442); Jean (1442); Sinbad (1447); an unnamed woman (1454); Marianne (1454); Jackie (1456); Max (1456); Ron (1458); Jimmy (1458); an unnamed over-55 woman (1462); Emma (1465); and Mike (1467). Patricia says she can't stop going to the loo in episode 1446; a bird "drops" on Sinbad in episode 1455; and although DD quietly mumbles that she needs to go after the darts match in the pub episode 1444, she rejoins her friends only 21 seconds after leaving them, so it would seem more likely that in that time she was told that the toilet was occupied or otherwise unavailable (maybe there was a long queue?), rather than matching the speed record held by Ron since episode 1224.

Goofs:

In episode 1452, Bev's seventh and ninth words are the wrong way round: "Don't forget to give Pat and my baby the best wishes".

Sinbad says the rival window cleaner causing trouble for Carl is "Dicky Williamson" in episode 1457, and "Dicky Williams" in episode 1458.

Trivia:

Rosie and Eddie do their shopping at Asda (1445), and won a speedboat when they appeared on "Bullseye", after Rosie threw the winning dart (1444). Their telephone number, seen on Carl's business card, is 051 269 3266 (1455). Eddie was a shop steward for 14 years (1464), but when facing re-election he loses, earning 48 votes against Joey's 57 (1463). Sarah lives at number 32 (1462). Stanley and Mabel have been to Bournemouth for two weeks (1449). Dicky Williamson and his brother's window round includes Lancaster Avenue, according to Sinbad in episode 1457; and in episode 1458, he would seem to be attributing Carl's further trouble in Tamworth Avenue, off Burrbank Road, to the same business rival.

Ron, who is right-handed (1466), once slipped a disc (1441), and helped to vote the present government into power (1470). He has five years' experience of bingo at the Legion (1458), looked like Billy Fury when he was younger (1463), and buys Mike a guitar and related equipment at Hessy's Music Centre, in which a poster advertising a "Beatles Festival" is displayed (1452). Keith is now working as a trainee in a London photography studio (1450). Jacqui currently earns £35 per week, according to Mike (1444), while Jimmy, in prison, is earning £9 per week (1443). His short-term cell-mate, Don, is in for shoplifting and, he claims, 32 other offences (1441).

Mick is again seen carrying containers marked "Tolona", the brand of pizza base he uses, in episode 1447. In their first few games, his football team lose 19-0 in episode 1448, 9-1 against "Holy Trinity" in episode 1450, and 13-1 in episode 1453, when Rachel is sent off. However, in episode 1459 Garry tells Mick that in their next game, against St Peter's, they had their best result yet, losing only 6-1.......although Rachel, the goal scorer, was booked again! "Brains" is Leo's favourite "Thunderbirds" character (1447), while Gemma's favourite sweets, according to Leo, are fruit gums (1449). The strawberry flavoured "Roses" chocolates are Carol's favourites (1442).

Bev lost her virginity at the age of 14 with a boy whose mother owned a sweet shop, and who was serving customers downstairs at the time (1446). She is stopped speeding in Wendower Road while driving Patricia to hospital (1450). Among the PR firms Patricia doesn't recommend is David Halliwell Associates, who are "too big" (1467). Max, who is right-handed (1464), buys a christening gown for Alice at John Lewis's (1463). According to Jean, who is right-handed (1466), Audrey is from the Formby end of Blundell Sands (1458), and David was once chased by a bull (1459). Among the LPs he brings to the over-55's club in episode 1462 are "Dream Along With Me" by Perry Como, and a Gene Pitney collection.

The "named nurse" on the sign above Terry's hospital bed is D. Blair (1441); Barry, who got Brian "Bamber" Hall's autograph as a kid (1470), is left-handed (1445, 1467); Penny, who used to fancy Michael Caine (1469), and reads "Horse And Hound" (1471), is right-handed (1467, 1468, 1470); Kenny is from Runcorn (1469); Greg has been shopping at "JD Sports" (1470); and Chris has now taken up a research post in California (1471). One of at least two glazier's vans parked on the Close in episode 1441 bears the name "Roby Glazing" and a telephone number beginning 051-220-; and the "Unit to let" sign seen on the parade in episodes 1454, 1465 and 1470 displays the telephone number of Fletcher's - 051 676 8866.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

For those that can remember what Mike historically did for the first time in episode 1334.......he does it again in episode 1464.

Episode 1470 begins, uniquely, with inter-cut scenes of DD and Ron, and Barry and Penny, as both couples have exactly the same conversation:

Quote:
DD (and Barry) : Hiya.

RON (and Penny) : Oh - 'morning, love.

BARRY (and DD) : Are you all right?

PENNY (and Ron) : Mmm, fine, thanks.

DD (and Barry) : Did you sleep all right?

RON (and Penny) : Yeah, yeah - went out like a light. Well, worn out, wasn't I? So how long have you been awake?

BARRY (and DD) : Dunno, half an hour or something. I've been doing some thinking.

PENNY (and Ron) : What about?

DD (and Barry) : Well, you know - about last night. Us. What it meant.

RON (and Penny) : Oh, right.

BARRY (and DD) : Well? What do you reckon?

PENNY (and Ron) : About us?

DD (and Barry) : Yeah. Are you going to stay? Are we gonna make a go of it?

PENNY (and Ron) : Well, seeing as I haven't had any better offer, why not, eh?


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Father Heaton tells Ron and DD that everything can be forgiven, although he must ask whether Bev will be making demands on Ron as Josh's father. DD says she believes Bev can cope on her own and they just want to forget about her. The priest confirms that he can renew their marriage vows at 3.30pm next Wednesday. DD is enthusiastic: " I can't believe this is happening. All those months of being so unhappy. I never thought it could be like this again.......".
