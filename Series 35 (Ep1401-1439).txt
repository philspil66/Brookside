The storylines:

Bev finally discovers that Josh is not Ron's son, and plans to have another baby that is. Jimmy finally discovers that crime does not pay - he is imprisoned for nine months. Mandy finally discovers that she doesn't want to lose Sinbad, and that Beth is having a lesbian relationship with one of her lecturers. So does David, and this surprisingly leads to a very strained atmosphere with Jean at the bungalow. Carl wants out of the army and his marriage to Sarah, Eddie has troubles at work, and Penny meets her late husband's mistress, then maybe a potential new husband, Barry! But when he attempts to use the same strong-arm tactics that have proved to be effective in other circumstances to evict Simon's cult from the house he has bought, he is taken hostage, and his new business partner Max thinks he has been abandoned and may lose everything. Simon intends that the house will be blown up after he and Terry leave, but the timer he uses for his bomb may not be quite as accurate as he thinks.......

"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

Episode 1403 includes scenes of Penny being interviewed on GMTV, shown as if they were being transmitted live on breakfast television, complete with captions and a clock in the corner of the screen, showing times between 8.15 and 8.30 that matched closely with the times in the evening at which this episode was originally broadcast!


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As Max and Patricia are leaving their home to go and report Barry's disappearance to the police, Simon sets the timer of his bomb and, believing that they have thirty minutes to get clear, goes upstairs with Terry to untie Barry and set him free. Beth, about to leave number 10, waves to Max and Patricia as they drive past - and, just as she turns back to lock the front door, the bomb explodes.......
