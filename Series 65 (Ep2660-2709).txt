For the final six seasons of "Brookside", a significant advantage of the previous sixty-four is lost, as the realism of video is replaced with the artificiality of filmised pictures. There are, however, still occasional opportunities to see the more effective pre-filmised versions in some of the "Next" sequences in the closing credits, and there is also the opportunity to see how much better parts of the storyline involving Anthony Murray and Imelda Clough in this season could have looked without this effect in the "Ten of the Best" feature on the 2003 VHS/DVD release "Brookside: Unfinished Business".

Six scenes of Anthony and Imelda towards the end of episode 2660 have accompanying incidental music, as do five scenes from the same storyline in episode 2697.

The only episodes featuring new appearances by Imelda are episode 2660, in which she is alive, then dead; and episodes 2661, 2675 and 2697, in all of which she is seen in Anthony's mind. Flashbacks of her appearances in episode 2660 are repeated in episodes 2661, 2669, 2672, and 2676, and some of her words from that episode are heard again in episodes 2663 and 2700 - again, as Anthony recalls his last encounter with her.

Two very brief scenes in episode 2661 are seen in black-and-white, from the point-of-view of a CCTV-camera; and several scenes in episodes 2673 and 2674 are from the point-of-view of "Rover" - a pig, who can also only see in black-and-white.

There are brief slow-motion scenes in episode 2661 (three teachers in a corridor) and episode 2672 (Anthony wrecking the lab); and parts of the similar, but not identical, scenes which end episode 2698 and are reprised at the beginning of episode 2699 (Bev rushing to Josh after he is knocked down) are also seen in slow-motion.

The Magic Rabbits are seen again in episode 2662, watched by Anthony; and the music is heard again at Ron's in episode 2675 - although it is unclear which, if any, of his grandchildren are watching.

The appearances of Susannah, Matthew, Emily and Dr Burton in episode 2670 are only in material, also featuring Max, originally seen in episodes that were aired in April 1997; and the appearances of Matthew and Emily in episode 2703 are in a flashback to a 1996 episode set in the Cotswolds.

Some inappropriate images from the end of episode 2670 were removed from the Channel Four omnibus repeat of that episode on Saturday 13th April 2002 - vastly improving the conclusion, and indeed the episode as a whole.

From episode 2671 onwards, the twelfth version of the opening sequence is used. It is, however, very similar to the one which has opened the first eleven episodes of this season, more than 300 other previous episodes, and which is accidentally re-used to begin episode 2688. The main difference is that the bar no longer displays the name "Bev's Bar".

Episodes 2682 and 2683 were originally broadcast in a different aspect ratio from the norm.

In episode 2705, Michael Atkinson begins his longest-running role as "Hookey Johnson", a record-equalling fourth different credited "Brookside" character played by the same actor.

On three occasions during one scene in episode 2706, we see separate split-screen pictures of Max and Jessie, as they converse with each other from opposite sides of the same door.

The storylines:

Despite Ray and Nikki's reservations, Helen is keen to trace her real mother and develop a relationship with Jimmy, even when she finds out about his manic depression and recent hospitalisation. Ron also needs to readjust, and find some new business ideas, when he is released from prison - but he somehow succeeds in convincing Max to swap houses with him. And while Anthony struggles to come to terms with accidentally drowning Imelda, the police seem to think Marty is a more likely killer.

Meanwhile, Tim and Steve have mixed fortunes "lifting and shifting" ; Katie Rogers becomes an appropriate name; Adele is getting through boyfriends at an impressive rate; and Bev and Sammy both have so many other problems with Josh and Louise that neither of them notice their kids' faces and voices have changed. A new family, the Gordons, arrive; Jacqui buys back the bar, and suffers an ectopic pregnancy; and Beth contracts meningitis - not diagnosed by Gary, who Mike reports for incompetence. And Gabby is menaced by a stalker from her past - but is her ordeal going to continue into the future?

The dates:

It is Easter Saturday in episode 2665, and it is Easter Sunday in episode 2666 - which, based on dialogue in episode 2663, is in April. Based on dialogue in episodes 2666, 2667 and 2668 and earlier appearances of Jacqui's 2002 Year Planner, it is Thursday 4th April 2002 in episode 2667 and Friday 5th April 2002 in episode 2668. Based on dialogue in episode 2674, it is Wednesday in episode 2675; it is Monday, and Jubilee Day, in episode 2692; and reference is made to an England v Argentina football match due to take place "on Friday" - presumably in the World Cup, which is "still on" in episode 2698. It is a year since Max and Jacqui's first kiss in episode 2694, Father's Day is "on Sunday" in episode 2696, and in that episode Marty recalls "a Sunday afternoon in Summer 1998". Based on dialogue in episode 2697, the events of episode 2660 took place on "March 20th of this year"; and "March 20th" is mentioned again as that date in episodes 2705 and 2706. Based on dialogue in episodes 2698 and 2699, it is Father's Day, and Sunday, in episode 2698 and the first part of episode 2699, then it is the following day - Monday - in the remainder of episode 2699. Based on dialogue in episodes 2699 and 2700, it is the following day - Tuesday - in episode 2700; and, based on dialogue in episode 2702, it was April in episode 2668.

Locations:

While the majority of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, Mike and Rachel appear in scenes set in a posh hotel in Buxton, Derbyshire - but not necessarily filmed there - in episode 2661.

Births:

None. Jacqui discovers that she is pregnant in episode 2662, and Max notes that the baby is due on the 27 NOVEMBER 2002 page of a diary in episode 2664. But in episode 2675 it emerges that the pregnancy was ectopic, and, following an operation to save her life, Jacqui is no longer pregnant.

It is Rachel's birthday in episode 2661; it is Diane's birthday in episode 2665; it is Steve's 22nd birthday in episode 2691; and it is Bev's 30th birthday - "next month" in episode 2683, and sooner in episodes 2696 and 2697 - in episode 2698 and in the first part of episode 2699. Emily, however, mistakenly believes it is her 40th birthday, and gives her a card with a large number "40" on the front.......

We learn that Friday 13th is not Leanne's birthday (2685), and that 21st May is not Jessie's birthday (2706). And, in episode 2691, we are told that Katie was about one year old, and Nisha was about 3, at the time of the Queen's Silver Jubilee [in 1977], and Nisha was six or seven when Charles and Di[ana] married [in 1981].

Jimmy is 50 (2663, 2687); Steve is 21 (2666); Max is 45 (2667); Imelda is [was!] 12 (2667, 2671); Ron is 54 (2670); Louise is 10 (2675, 2686); the unseen Mrs Coates is 81 (2675); Josh is 8 (2680); Diane is "nearly 40", according to Emily (2681); Mrs Tucker is 82 / 84 (2682 / 2685); Nic is 27 (2687); Stephanie is 12 (2691); the yet-to-be-seen Sylvia is in her sixties (2691); Katie is over 16 (2693); the unseen bullying victim David Liptrot was 11 in 1997 (2703); Adele is nearly 17 (2706, 2707); Stuart is under 16 (2707); and Luke is 4 (2709).

Marriages:

None. Jacqui is exaggerating for effect when she mentions that Max has been married 19 times in episode 2661; we are reminded that Jimmy and Jackie were married for 27 years in episode 2675; and we are told that Gary married Gabby in the year 2000 in episode 2692. It is Tim and Emily's wedding anniversary tomorrow in episode 2678, and it is Mike and Rachel's wedding anniversary in episode 2689. Lance reveals that the unseen owner of the "Palm D'Or" and his unseen wife are getting divorced in episode 2666, and Adele and Russell reveal that his unseen parents are doing likewise in episodes 2686 and 2687.

Deaths:

The "Brookside" death count passes eighty, with three further additions in this season. Imelda Clough drowns in episode 2660, with help from Anthony; Mrs Tucker, an elderly patient, dies of natural causes in Gary's surgery in episode 2682; and Rob Dexter commits suicide by throwing himself under a train in episode 2709. We are reminded that it was five years ago this week that Matthew and Emily died (2667, 2669), whereas Clint has been dead for one year (2687), and it was twelve months ago tomorrow / twelve months ago today / a year ago that he died (2681 / 2683 / 2695).

Unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters mentioned are Jimmy's mother (2677); Ray's first wife, Renee (2683, 2703); Katie's grandmother [Frank's mother] (2691); Tim's father (2692); Helen's [adoptive] father (2698); Diane's great-grandmother (2699); Linda / Rob's wife (2699, 2703 / 2682, 2705, 2709), who died of cancer (2699, 2705) last month (2699); Mickey Edwards' brother, who died of cancer and confessed to murder on his deathbed (2704); and Nikki's grandfather [Jessie's first husband, Tommy] (2707).

Toilet visits:

Sammy (2663), Ron (2681 - promising Max that he will only use two pieces of paper), Gabby (2693), Jimmy (2694), Diane (2701), Josh (2702, all over the floor), Alan (2708) and Ali (2709). Jacqui discovers that - to use her words - "Someone crapped in the pool" in episode 2673; and Ray is in the bathroom every five minutes, according to Ron in episode 2686.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Sylvia / Sylvia who became Morgan / Sylvia Morgan / Helen's mother (2674, 2677, 2686, 2693, 2694, 2696, 2698, 2707 / 2686 / 2687, 2690, 2691 / 2684, 2685, 2690, 2691, 2701); Tanya's father / Ted Moran (2685, 2687, 2693, 2705 / 2693, 2695); Adele and Steve's mother / "other mother" [Jan] (2673, 2686 / 2685); Kevin / Kevin Mallon (2701, 2708 / 2706, 2707), who works with Alan; and Tommo, a mate of Ali (2706, 2707). And we will also meet Baz, part of whose e-mail address - "baz@" - is seen on Stuart's computer screen, as he e-mails pictures to his mate in episode 2709.

Goofs:

One of Gabby's lines in episode 2682 sounds incomplete, or otherwise mangled: "As long as you accept that if only you hadn't gone and let your temper get the better of the situation.".

Mrs Tucker's age is given as 82 in episode 2682, and 84 in episode 2685.

In episode 2693, Jacqui surely means that she is "not trying" to be funny: "I'm trying not to be funny here, but you know he's not the best-behaved kid in the world, is he?".

Ray points out to Steve that the tax-disc on his car is out-of-date in episode 2698 - but it would be impossible for him to see this from the position in which we see him standing relative to the car's windscreen.

Gabby answers the telephone at work as "Gabby Parr" a few times in episode 2699, although it has previously been revealed that she uses her maiden name, "Thaxter", for business purposes.

One of Jessie's lines in episode 2707, "People used to help out in that years ago.", doesn't sound quite right.

Trivia:

Jimmy is seen with a bound document "The Stigma of Mental Illness" (2677) and a book "Walking With Both Feet", which has a foreword by Jo Brand (2701); and he discovers a book at Helen's entitled "New Hope - Bipolar Disorder" (2691). Among the items on his collage are a flier for a "KEN DODD SHOW" (2692, 2693), and the previously-seen newspaper article "The Class Divide and Drug Abuse" (2692). His internet searches, which are for "Sylvia Nancy Morgan" as well as "Sylvia Morgan", trace the address 26 Bowker Grove, Tuebrook (2686), which he and Helen visit (2692). She split up from her husband Clive when he took a promotion to Southend, to which she didn't want to move (2677). He got a job in a bank after studying business management, and they were living in Luton when Stephanie was born (2677).

Ron refers to his family as "the Dixons from Scotland Road" (2703). His number at H.M.P. Longley is 3645987, and the card he takes home shows his age as 54, his cell location as Wing D, Block F, Landing 4, and details of his crime: "30.11.2001 Guilty of possessing a shotgun without a certificate and the illegal possession of a prohibited weapon." (2668). He comes home in a taxi whose tax disc expires at the end of June 2002 (2668), and finds out from Jacqui that he has lost 73% of his customers (2669). She says she has owned her own business since she was 20, she swam for the county, and she qualified as a lifeguard (2667), and offers Bev £12,000 to buy back the bar, for which Bev recalls she originally paid over £90,000 (2662). Bev reminds Mike she has had no support from him [regarding Josh] for "nine and a half years" - which presumably includes the period during which she was pregnant, as well as the eight and a half years since he was born (2700).

Rachel receives in the post an offer for "£2,000 TO SPEND AS YOU LIKE", if she calls 0151 496 2501, in episode 2675, sent to her correct address, including the postcode L43 6TZ; and a similar letter, referring to a "cheque verification hotline" whose number is 0151 996 2022 in episode 2686.

Gabby, who is giving a presentation to "Ormerod Pharmaceuticals" (2699), studied in Leeds, and lived in Kilford at the time (2682). She first met Gary in 1998, at Christmas (2692). After Gary punched him, they paid a £30,000 out-of-court settlement (2705) to Rob, who Gabby thought was lecturing in Zambia (2682), but is in Liverpool, and has seen an office in Manor Park Avenue which he claims would be ideal for his consultancy (2699).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 2685, viewers who, like Rachel, don't notice that Ray is flicking through a small laminated book of fabric / lino / carpet samples from "Robert Allen" in the background as she examines Mike's teeth in the foreground, may well be as shocked as she is:

Quote:

RAY: Jessie and me were gonna have a shag in the new bedroom, but.......

RACHEL: You what ?!?


Jimmy has some interesting news about Lindsey in episode 2698, bearing in mind that the performer who played her, Claire Sweeney, has gone on to play "Roxie Hart" in a West End musical, "Chicago": "The company she works for loves her. There's even a chance she might go over to their headquarters in the States to do some training with them. Imagine that, our Lindsey in Chicago......."

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Gary feels that Rob had serious problems, and no-one could have helped him - if anyone is to blame for his death, it is the police, who should have gone round to see him as soon as Gabby reported him. He is sorry that Rob committed suicide, but thinks he took the easy way out, and it is the people he left behind who will find it tough. But Gabby is convinced that she is to blame - she could have called Rob back, as he only wanted to talk, nothing else. She told him she never wanted to talk to him ever again, even though his response was that he would kill himself if he didn't hear from her. "I said, go ahead and kill yourself. I told him to do it. And he did!".
