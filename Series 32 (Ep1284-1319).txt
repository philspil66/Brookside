The storylines:

Sexual harrassment in the workplace is a theme of this season, as Marianne suffers at the hands of her new boss Charles, and Mick ends up risking another court appearance by punching him. The Jordaches have to avert the threat of Trevor's body being discovered under their patio in more ways than one, including briefly digging him up again; while Jimmy is introduced to drugs by Brian, runs the nightclub surprisingly effectively in Barry's absence, and harrasses Peter until he decides to leave the Close for good, causing Mike and Keith to look for somewhere else to live. Meanwhile, Anna moves in with Terry, who is keen to marry her, but not only to legalise her stay in the UK; and there are three other marriage proposals too. The first married couple to emerge, surprisingly, are Max and Patricia, who have spent most of the season heading for, and achieving, divorce! After Frank does too much exercise and has a heart attack, he and Lyn also decide to marry in the near future; and Ron plans to marry Bev, after he believes he has convinced her not to abort the child that may or may not be his. But whose relationship is the return of Lyn's ex-husband going to seriously damage?

In episode 1309, Marianne seems torn between "look myself in the eye" and "look at myself in the mirror" when she says "look myself in the mirror".

Also in episode 1309, Terry replaces "than" with "in" ("I can't think of a better place to show it off in the nightclub").

David's declaration in episode 1319 that Patricia is his "only daughter" contradicts dialogue in episode 884 in which Patricia refers to her sister.

Trivia:

Max and Patricia were originally married in a registry office (1317), and remarry at Manor Park Register Office (1319). The registered office of Patricia's Oxford-based client, "Shield", is on the second floor (1312). Her uncle Clive - David's brother - and Aunt Penny live in Banbury (1319). David could not afford a wedding ring for Jean until he was demobbed (1308). He used to paint red crosses on the sides of ambulances when he was in the Medical Corps in the army (1306), and went to the "Butlins" in Skegness in 1936, when he drove a Morris Oxford (1290). Julia, who catches the bouquet at Patricia's wedding (1319), has been to Skegness, Bridlington, and Devon - "the West Country" (1315), including a visit to a "Butlins" with her Arthur in 1958 (1290).

Mandy was 18 when she first slept with Trevor (1299), who, by the time he died, had false teeth (1290). Beth was 14 when he slept with her (1300). She needs three "A"s and a "B" in her "A" levels for a place on a course at Guy's Hospital, London (1294), and those are the grades that she gets (1295), while Katie gets "A"s in her Dance and Drama, English and Computer Studies GCSEs, and "B"s in all her other subjects (1298). Frank is "strictly vinyl", having no CD player (1310). His band, the Scotty Dogs, performed at the Royal Iris, the Mardi Gras, the Grafton, New Brighton Town and Lytham Town Hall (1310). Steve is playing at the Kingsland, not far from Hamilton Square in Birkenhead (1312). Geoff is entitled to £20.88 per week income support (1318). Alison's favourite colour is purple (1318).

Jimmy is thinking about buying a house on the "Crocky" Park Estate (1315, 1316). According to Mike, who has just started his final year at college, Ron voted for "this lot" [the present government] (1316). He was not present at the births of Mike, Jacqui or Tony (1301). The florists' telephone number is 051-269-3826 (1306). Bev used to be a strippagram (1314), and worked in a club for six months (1312). She has been to Laura Ashley and Next looking for items for the flat (1315). Peter, who went to Christchurch College, Oxford (1309), hasn't seen the film "Jurassic Park" yet (1292). Anna has lived in England for five years (1289), including a year in Camden, where Marianne comes from (1300). Charles was the first black manager at Griersons' (1284); Brian is divorced (1304); and taxis bearing the telephone number 269 6699, from "Manor Car Hire", are seen in episodes 1284, 1293 and 1306.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

Bearing in mind the time-slot in which this season of "Brookside" originally aired, Julia's suggestion to David in episode 1315 is interesting: "I could come round about eight o'clock - there's never very much on the telly...."

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having learned from Lyn that Bev planned to get rid of the baby and go to work with Steve on a cruise ship, and is only staying with him because that job fell through, Ron declares that he has been played for a fool, and it is all over between them. He leaves the marquee, and Jimmy tries to comfort Bev, as Frank compares the confrontation to those Clive sees in the House of Commons! In the garden, Ron briefly looks back and sees Bev, but walks on, as she runs in the opposite direction.......
