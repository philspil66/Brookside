From this season onwards, commercially-released music is frequently audible in the background - occasionally on characters' radios, but mostly during scenes set in the bar. The first tracks to be heard are Another Level's "From The Heart" (in episode 2297) and the Spice Girls' "Spice Up Your Life", Maria Nayler's "Naked and Sacred" and Robert Miles' "Fable" (all in episode 2298).

For scheduling reasons, episodes 2299 and 2300 were originally broadcast on Channel Four edited into a double-length omnibus in a 60-minute time-slot.

The "Magic Rabbits" are briefly seen again, watched by Kylie, in episode 2311.

The cast and production credits of episode 2313 are replaced with an alphabetical list of who "Through the year 'Brookside' was brought to you by"....., and the "NEXT....." frame is replaced with images of many of those people waving from the "Millennium Club", which quickly expand to fill the whole screen.

The storylines:

While their flats are renovated, Nathan and Darren move to the Close, and Rachel and Mike move in with Anthea and Ron, become the proud parents of a Millennium baby, and announce their engagement just minutes after Jacqui announces hers. Tim and Leo get new jobs, Jackie gets a promotion, and Jimmy builds a "Millennium Arch"; while Susannah grudgingly lets Max move back in, mainly to look after the children; Katie's relationships with Ryan, then Luke, don't bring her much joy; and Mark repays Victoria's dedication by killing himself. After the racial tension on the Close diffuses with the horrific death of Josh, and Sinbad's hearing doesn't improve as much as he hoped, he and Mick turn into couch potatoes, blissfully unaware that the identity of Nikki's rapist is finally revealed, and she may now be able to start rebuilding her life - with or without Jerome. Emily gets a new boyfriend, and Jessie moves in with her granddaughters, often visited by the recently-widowed Ray, as Margi leaves for a new job in Brussels. The Musgrove family also leave the Close, going to.......well, who cares? Let's just be thankful they've gone! And Lindsey begins to struggle with her feelings for new friend Shelley, has to agree to work with the dodgy Dave at the "Millennium Club" when she is not able to repay her debt to the Finnegans even by thieving from her business partners, and will not be easily forgiven when Gemma collapses after taking some of his drugs.......

Locations:

Virtually all of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, the only exceptions being a number of scenes in episode 2302, which are set in Cuddington Hall, Cheshire, and scenes set in Didsbury, Manchester in episodes 2312 and 2315 (Mark and Victoria's house in both, and a local pub in the former).

Births:

One - Rachel, who has "five weeks to go" in episode 2295, "24 days to go" in episode 2299 [see "Moments" below] and is "nine months" pregnant / gone in episodes 2308 / 2309, gives birth to Beth just as the Millennium arrives in episode 2313. She is "due two days before Christmas" in episodes 2297 and 2299, "due two days before Ron's birthday" in episode 2298, "due this week" in episode 2307, and "due in 2 days" in episode 2308. Mike refers to the "family tradition" of Christmas Day births in episodes 2297 and 2305, as does Ron in episode 2308.

It is Emily's 16th birthday in episode 2285, and she is still 16 in episodes 2289, 2290, 2294 and 2300. Nathan is "not yet 30" in episode 2286 - but it is his birthday soon in episode 2305, and his 30th birthday arrives in episodes 2306 to 2308. We are reminded that Luke's 21st birthday was during the six months he spent in prison (2309), and we are told that Leo is 18 (2286, 2293, 2297); Kelly is 16 (2289); Gemma is 13 (2297); Lia is 3 (2308); Nathan's parents are in their late 60's (2309); Sinbad was 10 in 1966 (2310). Katie indicates that her star sign is "Aquarius" in episode 2289; Alec claims that he "can pass for 55" in episode 2290; and we are told that Ray and the late Renee have no children in episode 2298.

Marriages:

None. We are told Margi and Greg were married for 23 years in February (2284) [but see "Goofs" below"] and that Niamh and Joey have been married for 20 years (20). Jessie seems to be guessing/implying that Ray was married to the unseen Renee for at least 30 years in episode 2302, although he doesn't confirm how accurate she is at this point.

Deaths:

Three - Josh Carter fatally sets himself on fire for Hallowe'en in episode 2286, Mrs Wilcox dies of a terminal illness in episode 2309, and Mark Wilcox falls down the stairs to his death in episode 2312, not necessarily due either to his motor neurone disease or suicidal intentions. Ray's unseen wife Renee, also mentioned in episodes 2294 and 2300, dies in episode 2297, keeling over with a heart attack just after calling "House" to win the jackpot at bingo; and her funeral, which is "next Wednesday" (2298), will be the fifth Jessie has been to this year (2299). Other unseen dead characters who are mentioned are: Jerome's father (2286); Victoria's grandfather (2286); Tim's father (2287, 2303); Jackie's father (2298); Nathan's grandmother (2302); Shelley's father, George Bowers (2303), who died shortly after he retired (2311); Ray's father (2310); Jimmy's mother (2310); and Jimmy's brother Franky (2310).

Toilet visits:

In her last month of pregnancy, Rachel is "sick of wanting to go to the toilet" in episode 2295, goes in episode 2306 (asking Mike "How many times have I been to the loo today?" - but he hasn't been counting!) and goes again in episode 2310. So do Matt (2290 and 2308), Jerome (2298 and 2301), Luke (2308), an unnamed man (2308), Gemma (2310), Charlotte (2312), and Darren (2312); and Emma has filled her nappy in episode 2287.

Susannah's mother (2287, 2289); Ray's brother in Bournemouth (2305), Bernard (2310); Nathan's older brother (2309); and Paula, Shelley's ex-lover (2311).

Goofs:

Margi says that she and Greg were married for 23 years in February in episode 2284, contradicting the previous mention of their wedding anniversary in episode 2205, when it was June!

Jackie mispronounces Mick's surname as "JohnsTon" at one point in episode 2292; Jessie uses the singular when she means the plural in episode 2294: "This is Emily, the younger of my granddaughter."; and Jacqui mispronounces the first word of a phrase of French origin, "Chez Ron", as if it rhymes with "fez", in episode 2305.

In episode 2309, in revealing that she has decided to join her family on holiday to Madeira, Nikki misleadingly adds an extra "here" after "Crimbo": "I'd rather spend Crimbo here with you, me mum and our brat, than here with Ray and a turkey leg."; and in episode 2314, what should be Alec's second word doesn't arrive until after his third and fourth words: "It's what you just deserved.".

Trivia:

Shelley's business card, seen up close in Lindsey's hand in episode 2291, reads: SHELLEY BOWERS, Interior Design, 4 Langham Lane, Manor Park, Liverpool L43 8ZB. Tel./Fax 0151 692 5941. The "F" page of Lindsey's personal telephone book, seen in episode 2299, lists Rose Finnegan's home number as (0151) 496 0009, and the number of the unseen "Sam Fletcher" as (0151) 429 0142. Shelley went to grammar school and elocution lessons, her mother is a shop assistant (2303), and her father was a council clerk (2303, 2311) in the rates department (2311). Her Christmas present to Jimmy, who once built a multi-purpose TV, hifi and album unit when he and Jackie lived in a flat in Station Road (2293), is the "Book of Millennium Records" (2311).

Mark is [and was!] an accountant (2309), and an only child (2310). He is rung by "St Mary's" with the news that his mother has had a stroke (2305), there is art by Richard Diebenkorn on display in his home (2315), and he honeymooned in Mexico (2288) with Victoria, who once gave an assembly in front of the whole school with her skirt tucked into her knickers (2286). Charlotte is from Croydon, comes from a family of railway workers, and is a physiotherapist working at Darren's practice a couple of days a week (2286); and Deborah used to be a leading light in the church choir (2300). Nathan has inherited a house in Holland Park, London, from his grandmother (2302); and Louise is a teacher of deaf children at the Knotty Ash County Primary School, which Mr Moore visits with Sinbad (2298).

Margi discovers Susannah's number appearing seventy-four times on Greg's last telephone bill in episode 2284 - and it must be 0151 692 6145, based on the page we see, on which just three other numbers (0186 984 983, 0547 384 270 and 0798 143 746) each appear once only. Jessie has been shopping at Asda (2300), and Ray's hobby is making sculptured wind-driven garden ornaments (2300, 2304). Tim has a "Beatles" poster on the wall of his bedroom/garage (2289), and Nikki has posters of George Clooney (2297, 2298), Peter Andre (2298), "Five" (2298), and "All Saints" (2298) on her bedroom wall. Following her abduction, the headline of a "Daily Post" article seen briefly on-screen a few times in episode 2297 is "Student charged over kidnapping".

Mick has worked for 25 years (2294), and Leo is earning the minimum wage of £3.60 per hour (2301). Katie says her sister [Sammy!] is now living in Burton-upon-Trent (2307), and asks a taxi-driver to take her and Luke to a pub in Hartley Road (2308). Mike - "Michael Dixon" - is named as the licensee on the new sign installed outside "Bar Brookie" (2295), he is seen reading the book "All You Ever Needed To Know About Being A Dad" by Dr Matthew Wilson (2297), and gains a daughter weighing 7lb 11 oz at birth (2314). The "Goldline Taxis" logo and the telephone number 0151-269-9696 are seen again on Ryan's taxi in episodes 2294 and 2295; Jacqui (2287, 2303), Charlotte (2288), Jackie (2293, 2304), Joey (2294, 2305), Sinbad (2298), Jessie (2304), Tim (2304), Niamh (2305, 2315), and Luke (2310) are all right-handed; and Jimmy is left-handed (2296, 2298, 2299).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 2299, on December 1st, there is a subtle indication of Rachel's arithmetical ability, as she calculates how long it is until the baby is due, as Mike reminds her, "two days before Christmas" - "I've got 24 days to go yet.".

Episode 2308 is one of very few in which the barman later known as "Quiet Paul" is heard (quietly!) speaking. His words are "Where's Mike?".

In episode 2309, Jerome is briefly seen looking at page 430 of Channel Four teletext, the rugby index (in which the main headlines are "IRISH JOIN THE RACE TO CAPTURE LOMU", "Aussie Star Kearns slams Cup Chiefs", "Cardiff supremo targets Horan Group", and "WAKEFIELD STILL HOPING TO NET JONAH"), before switching to page 450, the cricket headlines.......and carefully-placed Christmas tinsel makes it impossible to see the date displayed on the top line of the screen, which would no doubt have been the day the scene was recorded rather than that on which it was set!

There is a marvellous revelation that Jacqui practises what she preaches in episode 2315 - while she is trying to reach Lindsey, it is very briefly possible to see that the display on her mobile phone says she is calling "CRUELLA".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As the Musgroves' van drives away out of the Close, Lindsey arrives home and unlocks the door. But Jackie takes her keys from her, and says she won't be using them again - she can get into the gutter where she belongs. Lindsey tries to justify her actions, and appeals to Jimmy for help - but his only reaction is annoyance when Jackie blemishes his "Millennium Arch" with some of Lindsey's blood, when she viciously shoves her against it! She reminds Lindsey of the effects drugs have had on their family, including the death of Little Jimmy, and can't believe that she has allowed their sale in the nightclub, leading to Gemma becoming seriously ill. "Go on, Lindsey - get out of my sight!".
