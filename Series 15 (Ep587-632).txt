Several clips of the "Magic Rabbits" are seen on Sizzler's television in episode 614 as Barry and Penny play, and fast-forward through, parts of the programme on the video cassette which he has led them to believe contains a recording of them in bed together.

Among the performers in the minor roles are Colin Fay, who had played the short-lived, yet legendary, "Doctor Who" character "Condo" several years earlier; and Valerie Lilley, who would appear in another Mersey Television production many years later, as "Mrs Knuckle" in "Grange Hill" !

The storylines:

Rod and Tracy both have some troubles at work and with Kirsty and Jamie; and Sheila moves in with the Corkhills after briefly occupying an awful bedsit, soon becoming the first to discover that Annabelle is having an affair. Paul also has his suspicions, though, as does Gordon, after facing and overcoming prejudice, leaving the Close with Chris, then breaking up with him. Chrissy and Frank have a variety of problems with all of their children - particularly Growler, who does a disappearing act - but successfully outwit Harry's plans to get them out of his house, although he is too busy wooing Betty to realise this yet. Barry's latest relationship is not altogether successful, but things look more promising for Jonathan and Cheryl, after he travels half way around the world and convinces her not to marry someone else, and for Terry and Sue, who get engaged. But how will the unexpected return of someone from her past affect their plans?

The dates:

There are only the following specific references: It is June in episodes 588 and 591, and Father's Day / Sunday in episode 589. It is Monday in episode 590, and American Independence Day / Pam Schriver's birthday, in episode 593. It is Thursday in episode 595; and, based on other references to Tracy's birthday, it must be Tuesday in episode 607. The Olympics are on television in episode 613 (Harry is planning to watch them); it is leap year in episode 614: and Hallowe'en in episode 628. In episode 629, Damon died a year ago last next week, and it will soon be Remembrance Sunday. Finally, we are told in episode 632 that "Operation Hickory", seen in episode 606, took place on 15th August.

Goofs:

In episode 587 Jonathan claims that Laura would have been 25 today - but her accident was on her 24th birthday, which was much less than a year earlier.

Spot the contradiction in Ralph's statement in episode 591: "Listen, mate - over the past six months we've had every conceivable concoction stuffed inside them pancakes. We've had ham, jam, tomatoes, mushrooms, raisins, even sardines. It's June, Harry. We've been scoffing those pancakes since February.".

Sheila talks about "changing", rather than "exchanging", contracts in episode 601.

Penny's second and third words (and maybe the fourth and fifth as well) seem to be in the wrong order in episode 601: "I wouldn't probably be still walking the earth".

In episode 613, neither Growler's words, "I thought I was going for my eyes tested", nor Paul's "Surprised you're spending so much trouble over it", sound quite right.

Also in episode 613, the envelope containing the concert tickets which arrives in the post for Annabelle is stamped, but not postmarked.

Tommo's surname, previously established as Tomlinson, becomes "Thomson" in episode 615, as Rod frantically radios for help after his friend is knived. Well, maybe his memory was temporarily disturbed.......

Episodes 620 and 624 are the fourth and fifth in which the registration number of Harry's car, parked in the background, mysteriously becomes YKA 168W instead of AWA 40X.

In episode 621 Chrissy tells Frank that "Katie's got her dancing class tonight", so it is surprising that later on, in episode 628, Katie is seen asking them if she can have dancing lessons!

Trivia:

Annabelle used to like shopping at Banks of Southport (613). Molly Harrison is now in the Netherlea Nursing Home for the Elderly (601), and Mona, who lived in Kendal for 40 years, joins her there (602). The bedsit into which Sheila briefly moves is number 17 (617, 618). The parents of Sizzler, who used to be in the army 594), split up when he was 8 (594). According to Penny, her marriage has been dead for seven years (603).

Billy reads the "Daily Post" (631). Jamie, who reads Billy's "Sunday Mirror" (589), has been on the dole for 7 months (607). Kathy has bought a dress for £8.95 in a sale at "Jill Wray's" (595). Betty's late husband Reggie used to have an Escort (617). She never learned to drive (617).

Jonathan has been working on the Rowley and Watkins contract (587, 588). It is two years before he buys into the partnership (611). His rival for Cheryl, Ben(wall), is from Ottowa (608), and lectures at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver (608). Cheryl answers Jonathan's telephone with its last four numbers, 9004 (631). Donna is now working as a floating courier on a cruise liner (608).

The Rogers' shop at Tesco's (610). Katie, who has a toy called "Mr Koala" (598), is in the first year, and Geoff is in the third year (611) at Brookside Comprehensive, whose head [presumably the recent successor to Mrs Pierce!] is Mr D. H. Davies B.S C. (612). Mr Jenkins is the third year pastoral head, and Sammy's biology teacher (622). There are 1000 pupils in the school (622) - including Ronnie, whose 25-year-old cousin is on her second marriage and third kid (596). Sammy's new friend Nisha is from India, and her parents have a shop (618). She shares a bedroom with three of her sisters (632).

The "For Sale" sign at the Grants' house bears the telephone number 051 259 9180 for the sellers, Assurance Trust", of 46-48 Kennedy Road, Liverpool 12 (591, 593, 600, 601 and others). Having previously been mentioned as Brian Lawrence's business number too, the very same phone number also appears on the door of one of his tow trucks, seen in episode 609 !!

Blink-and-you-miss-it moment:

In order to conceal the fact that neither Debbie Reynolds nor any stand-in appears in episode 600 as Katie, despite there being a scene in which the Rogers set off on holiday together as a family, there is so much luggage in the back seat and on the back window-ledge of their car that it is impossible to see her. Viewers are left to assume that, when Frank tells Katie to sit down, she obeys!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

The doorbell rings, and Jonathan goes to answer it, practising the German phrases he needs to use, and reminding himself just one more time that he mustn't mention the war. Before they come out of the kitchen, Terry assures Sue that Jonathan has just been winding Cheryl up, and their dinner guest is not really a German called Klaus at all - as Cheryl soon finds out, when she is introduced to Martin Howes. However, when Sue sees who has arrived, she becomes flustered, apologises and rushes out of the house, followed by a bemused Terry.......
