The storylines:

Derek contemplates suicide, but decides instead to leave the priesthood to be with Margaret; and, when she leaves the Farnhams in the lurch, Max installs a new nanny, Anna. On Brookside Parade, Jimmy opens a 50p shop, and Mick and Ellis take over a pizza parlour set up by Terry, who finally learns what Barry has done to Sue, and spends a lot of time in police custody. Tracy returns to the Close in time for Rod's wedding to Diana, and Peter returns home to discover that John has had a severe asthma attack. DD and Ron split up temporarily, and Sinbad and Marcia split up, perhaps permanently? And while Lyn looks like a possible rival to Denise for Frank's affections, Katie is not keen for him to see anyone else, and Sammy causes him more strife by abandoning her newly-born baby, Louise. Will Owen ever see his daughter again?

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

Episode 1084 is one of not many episodes in which binmen can be seen going about their work on the Close in the background, while more interesting things are happening in the foreground!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

While most of the residents are at a barbecue party following the wedding of Rod and Diana, Frank waits at home with Sammy and Owen for news. Finally he is telephoned by the hospital at which Sammy has abandoned Louise, and although he insists that he and the family are able to care for her, he is amazed to be told that they are keeping her in for further checks. "Why can't we have our baby back? They've taken her from us!"
