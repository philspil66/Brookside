The storylines:

A lottery syndicate set up by the Banks and the Crosbies wins Â£500,000, and David and Jean go off on a trip around the world, once Eddie and Rosie are eventually convinced, largely through being ostracised, not to keep all the money for themselves just because Rachel forgot to give them their Â£2 stake. Unfortunately, Rosie promptly becomes hooked on bingo and scratchcards, and within months she has spent all of their winnings, and even started stealing to fund her habit! Ron dies - but only very briefly - after mistakenly thinking Bev is having an affair with Peter; Mike's new hobby seems to be taking driving tests; and Max is neglecting his family, and being tempted by Susannah, again. There are also a few arrivals, departures and relocations, as Jenny is arrested and imprisoned after holding Mick hostage at gunpoint, Carl leaves for a job in Dubai, Mandy and her new baby Ruth move to Bristol instead of marrying Sinbad, and Dil is replaced at La Luz by a rejuvenated Terry, back from overseas and now the owner of all of Barry's properties. Sinbad moves into number 5 with Mick; after a few weeks there, Sarah moves to a flat on the parade; and the bungalow is rented by Jacqui, Rachel and Katie, who is dumped by new boyfriend, Christian, after they both fear that they have AIDS. And Jimmy and Jackie are joined at number 10 by daughter Lindsey and son-in-law Gary, whose determination to become involved with Jimmy's drug-dealing instead of his new taxi business looks likely to create more than a few problems for the household.......

Locations:

There are scenes of David and Jean in their hotel room in Bath in episode 1633, although this room doesn't really look appreciably different from one that might be found in or near Liverpool, where the rest of the action in this season is set.

Births:

One - Ruth Elizabeth Sweeney, daughter of Sinbad and Mandy, is born in episode 1635, weighing 6 lb 2 oz (1637), despite being due in "two and a half weeks" in episode 1634. It is Leo's birthday in episode 1627; it is Jimmy's birthday soon in episode 1650; and Jackie celebrates her birthday, which is soon in episode 1654, in episode 1655. We are also told that Bev is 24 (1618); Rosie is 40 (1625); the unseen Kirk, subject of a radio dedication, is 5 today (1635); Rebecca is 5 (1637); Rachel is 16 (1647, 1648, 1649) / nearly 17 (1648); Mike is over 21 (1648) / in his early twenties, according to David (1653); Caroline was the same age as Katie (1657); and Ron was [is!] twelve years older than Max (1658).

We are told in episode 1634 that Janice is engaged to the unseen Pablo in Magaluf; Julia implies that it will be 46 years since her wedding day in June (1650); Rosie claims, dubiously, that her unseen workmate Karen Jost is soon to be married (1647); and Jackie implies that she and Jimmy have been married for 23 years [she actually says that's how long she has been going through his pockets!] (1665).

Deaths:

Two - Terry reveals in episode 1656 that Caroline Lewis has died of AIDS, caught from Simon, in August; and Kiev the chicken becomes Kiev the ex-chicken in episode 1657, after eating an organic meal that Bev had prepared for Ron. Unseen characters who are no longer alive but mentioned are: Mr Woods, a 59-year-old angina sufferer and friend of the Crosbies, who are on their way to his funeral (1628); and relatives of Julia - her uncle Ray (1639), her husband, Arthur (1650, 1658), her father (1650) and her father's mother, Grandma Roberts (1650).

Carol McCarthy, the deputy head at Jenny's school (1620); Gina, a mate of Janice who won Â£300 out of a 50-member lottery syndicate (1625); Jenny's mother (1627); Mrs Morrison, a salon customer (1629); Russell, a mate of Lee (1630); Miss Dawson, Gemma's Maths teacher (1631); Tim Falconer, estate agent contact of Max (1631); Richard, quiz contestant (1633, 1651); Pablo, Janice's fiance (1634); Janice's mother (1634); Pablo's mother and father (1634); Aggie and Josie, Mo's bingo partners (1636); Elaine, beauty parlour employee (1638); Colin's mother, Cathy's mother-in-law (1640); Christian's father (1641); Peter's mother (1642, 1653); Karen Jost, who is leaving Rosie's work today (1647); Simon, a contact of Max (1648); Kev, a mate of Peter (1649); Avril, a mate of Bev (1650, 1651, 1652, 1653); Mrs Carr, a salon customer (1654); Mrs Andrews of 13 South Bank Road, and Mr Wood of 32 King George Street, who both want a cab (1659); Brian (1659), Tony (1659), and Lenny (1660), cab drivers; Eleanor, a poor worker at "Grants" (1660, 1662); Brian Parsons, Round Table Chairman (1661); Ken, contact of Jimmy (1662); Georgie at the pub, a druggie (1662); and Maria, who works for Max (1664).

Goofs:

Carl misses out "me" between "wanted" and "to" in episode 1622: "And here's me thinking you were just trying to get in my good books because you wanted to move in across the road, so you could stash your cash".

Susannah adds a second letter to her first word in episode 1630: "It really could do with getting ahead of the rest".

Although David is only going away for the weekend in episode 1632, he asks Rachel to record "Crimewatch" for him.......which airs on a weeknight!

The Banks' lottery win, with five numbers plus the bonus ball, is Â£100,000 - but in reality this would not be a round-sum amount!

The number on the front door of the house Jackie closes as she and Jimmy leave to move to the Close in episode 1633 is number 7, and she recalls that Lindsay took her first steps there. However, on the only previous occasion in which the Corkhills' front door was seen (in episode 1188, less than three years earlier) their house number was 100.

Katie either omits the word "hear", or replaces "of" with "to" in episode 1658: "I'm too frightened to what they'll tell me".

Max mixes up a couple of similar phrases in episode 1660: "Let's just keep things into perspective".

Trivia:

Jackie passed her driving test on her first attempt (1626). The house she and Jimmy leave to move to the Close is number 7 (1633). Jackie's sister, Val, once had swabs left inside her after a hospital operation, took the hospital to court and received compensation (1623). Lindsey and Little Jimmy used to have sugar puffs for breakfast (1650). Taxis bearing the telephone number 269 6699 from Manor Park Car Line (1625) / "Korky Kars" (1642) can be seen. Jimmy, who is left-handed (1629, 1646), instructs a driver to pick up a fare from 116 Mountford Street (1625). His home is raided as part of "Operation Toffeeman", in which, according to the headline of a newspaper report read by Jackie, "Dawn Raid Smashes Drug Dealers" (1663). A milk float seen in the Close in episode 1660 is from Harrison's Dairies, 27-29 Belmont Rd, L6 5BG.

The house where Susannah used to live, which was sold before she went to America, where Emily was in the "fourth grade", and Matthew was "about to start junior high" (1628), was in Colindale Drive (1631). She is seen getting into a taxi bearing the telephone numbers 480 7777 and 220 7777 (1637). According to Max in episode 1661, Brian Parsons, never seen but originally mentioned more than five years earlier as being a new member of the Round Table (in episode 991), is now its Chairman. Jean (1620), Leo (1627), Gemma (1632), the driving test examiner (1646), Jacqui (1646, 1653), Mick (1652), Julia (1654), David (1657), Lindsey (1659) and Gary (1661) are all right-handed, whereas Mo is left-handed (1651), and goes to "Rialto Bingo" on George Street (1651). According to a local radio news report, there has been a pile-up in Queens Drive (1653).

Eddie and Rosie are paying their solicitors Â£140 per month (1649). The first five lottery numbers drawn, all of which are on their winning ticket, are 24, 15, 33, 14 and 9 (1633). As the sixth number is the "bonus ball" drawn (1633), the prize is Â£100,000 (1634). Eddie borrows the video "Lovers and Loving" from Ron (1632), whereas Sinbad is seen with the book "Canal Dreams" by Ian Banks, which he has borrowed from Mike, and offers to pass on to Mick (1650). Mick's stalker, Jennifer Alison Swift, is sent to prison for three years (1655), although she is shown as "Jenny Swift" on a list of those due in court on the same day, which Mick studies in episode 1624. Also being charged that day are: Terry Melia, Thomas Summers, Gary Mayers, Thomas Murphy, Roy Rimmer, Robert Shaw, Colin Bott, Paul Dean, Caroline Marsh, Frank Boyd, Terry Murphy and Pauline Cooper.

When Bev claims, falsely, that she went out to a club somewhere on Cumberland Street, Mike suggests that it might have been "The Lomax" (1651). He is seen taking his first and third driving tests in cars from the Manor Park School of Motoring, bearing the telephone number 269 3404 (1626, 1652). During the first one, Julia gets into the back of the car while he is waiting at a junction in Dominic Road (1626). There is a Beatles poster in the room in her house which used to be Doreen's, and into which Peter moves (1650). She will have lived where she is now for 46 years this June (1650), and watches "Neighbours" (1654), whereas Rachel watches "Hollyoaks" (1638), and "Coronation Street" is Ron's favourite (1658). Shane is from "Meadowcroft Park" (1623), and also played Greg Brady in "Sunset Bay" (1638, 1664), in which there was a character called Cheryl (1638).

A plague reading "In loving memory of Sue and Danny Sullivan, who died tragically at this spot 4th October 1991" is erected in episode 1636 and seen again in episodes 1638 and 1655; and Mick's van, showing the pizza parlour's telephone number as 0151 269 2434, is seen again in episode 1627. His flat on the Parade is number 4 (1620, 1625, 1626), while Jacqui and Katie still have an "Oasis" poster on the back of the door to theirs (1623, 1626, 1641, 1647, 1655, 1656, 1657, 1658). Katie, who still has a poster of "Thelma and Louise" on her bedroom wall (1653, 1657) likes the music of Cast, Menswear and Blur, as does Christian (1641). Mandy was in labour for nearly two days with Rachel (1636), who has "Reservoir Dogs" on video (1633).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 1650, Julia remembers the past: "When our Renee was little, I used to have her fed and in bed before my Arthur was even home from work. And Grandma Roberts lived with us. That's my father's mother. I had her to look after as well as run the home.". While this may sound inconsequential, it is actually quite a revelation - if "Grandma Roberts" was Julia's father's mother, then Julia's father was "Mr Roberts", and the young lady who married Arthur Brogan many years ago was.......Julia Roberts!!!

And, from episode 1663, could the following be a minor homage to a very famous scene from an episode of "Dad's Army"?

Quote:
DETECTIVE INSPECTOR FERGUSON [to Jimmy]: Are you James Corkhill?

GARY STANLOW: Don't say anything, Jimmy!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having found his stash of cash and drugs missing, Jimmy believes the police are about to catch up with him and is packing his things to go on the run, when Jackie comes home and reveals that it was she who found the drugs, and now she knows that he has been lying to her. He tries to persuade her that she should have realised all along, and won't apologise for now being able to give her everything she wants, reminding her of the much poorer quality of life they used to have - but she is still disgusted that everything is being paid for with money earned from selling drugs.
