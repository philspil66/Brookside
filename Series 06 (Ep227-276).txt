Performers of minor roles in this season include Susan Twist and Alan Rothwell, later to play Rosie Banks and Nicholas Black; and Malandra Burrows and Paula Tilbrook, who would both go on to play major roles in "Emmerdale".

The closing credits to episode 232 begin over a moving aerial view of Liverpool, starting from the tower, on the inside of the windows of which the Hughes lads have painted letters spelling out "FREE GEORGe JACKSON". This then fades into the normal closing image of the Close.


The storylines:

Marie initiates a campaign to "Free George Jackson", but eventually has to admit defeat, and moves to Leeds. Michelle joins her, after cheating on Terry. Sheila gives birth, but finds returning to motherhood difficult. Paul and Bobby are on opposing sides in an industrial dispute at PetroChem. Annabelle sets up a catering business, Damon starts on a Youth Training Scheme, and Pat has to consider alternative careers after being sacked. Edna picks some winners at last......but is then mugged; and Heather has no shortage of potential replacements for Roger, but has she found the right one yet?


The dates:

It is reasonable to suppose that most scenes are set on approximately the dates on which the episodes were originally aired. There are only occasional more specific references that it is New Year's Day (227), January/after Christmas (228 ); Winter (229); January 28th (235); Valentine's Day (240); February 1985 (242); Easter Sunday (254); Monday (260); May Day bank holiday (263); May (264); Bank Holiday Monday (269) and 1985 (276). In episode 242 Damon mentions that he has lived on Brookside Close for two and a half years; in episode 245 Heather's diary shows "STUART, THEATRE" for Friday 8th; and it is observed in episode 247 that the next PetroChem AGM (Annual General Meeting) will be in April 1986.

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, except that in episode 240 there are scenes of Marie, Betty and Rick in Downing Street, London, to which they have travelled by train. In episode 247 there are several dialogue-free scenes of Heather going shopping in various London stores, including Harrod's; and in episodes 259 and 260 Heather and Tom are seen in quite a few different locations while holidaying in Portugal.

Births:

The first "Brookside" birth takes place in episode 230, with the arrival at 2.40pm of Claire Grant, weighing 6 lb 4 oz. In episode 239 she is six weeks old, and in episode 273 she is nearly six months old. In episode 246 Sheila observes that when Claire is 16, she will be 60. In episode 251 it is Bobby's birthday, and in episode 274 he is 48. In episode 273 he tells his doctor that Sheila is now 45 - unfortunately, her 44th birthday was only a few months ago....... In episode 243 it is Damon's 17th birthday, in episode 257 it is Kate's birthday, and in episode 264 it is Annabelle's. Gary is still 11 (244). Marie is still 35 (246), and Karen is still 18 (250, 256). Gordon is still 16 (250, 264) - this is the same age as Lucy, now 19 (264), was when she went to France (250). Andrew is 18 (256); Jonathan McCabe is 56 (232); Mrs Bancroft is 36 (240). Carol says her daughter is 13 in episode 262, but is equally sure she is 12 in episode 264. Mr Davis was born on 10th October, and his first child was also born on the 10th (267).

Toilet visits:

Betty (232, 236); Pat (236); Matthew and Helen (254); and in episode 272 Karen complains that Terry disturbed her sleep by going about three times during the night!

Characters mentioned but not seen yet.......perhaps on the way later:

Goofs:

In episode 231 Bobby refers to the "SexualS Discrimination Office", and in episode 250 he says Karen is taking "O" levels - she's done them, now she's taking "A" levels!

Although Sandra has previously claimed to be divorced, it emerges in episode 239 that she is not, as her husband Ian's new girlfriend Hana arrives to ask her to divorce him so that they can marry.

Damon overdoes the "already"s in episode 259: "I've already been attacked twice already".

In episode 263 Ralph tells Terry that McArdle OWES, rather than OWNS, the betting shop.

In episode 266 Pat refers to "my ILLITERATE scrawl", when he surely means "illegible".

The disco music is so loud at times in episode 250 that parts of the dialogue are difficult to hear; and a yapping dog can be heard in the background of several of the Portugal scenes in episode 260.

Trivia:

Paul now reads the "Daily Telegraph" instead of the "Guardian" (275). He awards the maintenance contract at PetroChem to Woodward and Lynch (227, 228, 229, 234, 237, 238, 251, 269); it begins on 27th May (261, 268 ). David Quinn is the Chairman of the Board at PetroChem (247) - perhaps he has recently replaced "Hay", who was mentioned as holding this role in episode 172. Annabelle's cleaner, Carol Thompson, left home when she was 17 and pregnant (264).

Edna chooses six horses for an accumulator bet with the initials "H", "A", "R", "O", "L" and "D". The last one, "D-Day Dodger", is the only one which doesn't win (255). Raymond is Tommy McArdle's cousin and business manager (266). Tommy's mother brought Raymond up after his parents died (266).

The book Janet gives Bobby for his birthday is "The People's War" by Angus Calder (251). The name-plate outside the clinic Bobby visits refers to E. Hartley B.D.S. and W. J. Duthie B.D.S., who have a dental practice there (274). Matty knows someone living in Avonside Road that had a vasectomy (272). George Williams is a Methodist (275), and Dr Rose is Jewish (273). Father Daley, who baptises baby Claire, also baptised Barry, Karen and Damon (253). Ruth, who Sheila leaves Claire with, lives in Newton Avenue (246).

Sheila has never passed an exam (270). Karen is offered a place at Lancaster University (237), but needs two Bs and a C to be accepted by Liverpool (273). Her "A" Levels start "next week" in episode 270, and in episode 273 her Sociology exam is on Thursday. In episode 275 she sits the exam. Terry has no "O" levels (272). He works at "Hurley's Club" (266, 271). Bin-bag seller Dawn "Bonecrusher" Finney lives in Charnwood Street (253). Derek Halligan is the managing director of the decorating firm at which Damon begins a Youth Training Scheme (261). Tony Harding worked for him for 10 months (262).

Sandra spends much of episode 236 reading the book "The Smoke Ring - The Politics Of Tobacco" by Peter Taylor. Pat, who has a degree in food technology (275), gives Kate an Eddy Grant record for her birthday (257). Kate prefers to watch the news on Channel Four, because it is slightly less biased (236). She once lived in a haunted house in Shepherd's Bush (276). Dougie earns £73 a week as a hospital porter (232).

Heather's telephone number is still 2599180 (257). She hasn't seen Roger for over a year (244). She is assigned to work on the acquisition by Cosgrove of Clarke's (227). Cosgroves' rivals Oakdens also want to acquire Clarke's (227). The hotel she stays at in Portugal with Tom is the Estoril Sol (259). They later plan to dine at the Millbrook Restaurant (275, 276). Another client she has to visit is the Van Der Klershes (273). Heather's assistant Greg is left-handed (255). Don Summerhill's telephone number is 2468085 (245).

Tom Curzon went to Font Hill Primary School and Bootle Grammar School (258). He met "the right girl" 12 years ago, but she married a quantity surveyor (259). He set up Curzon Communications in 1973 (258 ). Malcolm Pollock is the "FD" [Finance Director], Mike Harrison is one of its accountants (243, 252), the Chief Accountant is Deakin Matthews (244, 252), the head of sales is Roy Gilchrist (252), and the storeman, who has been with the company since it started (245), is Archie Rivers. One of their customers is Harding & Seeley (245), .

Michelle is receiving £7,500 pa for ten years from Petra's estate (253). She moves to 1A Catchmere Park, Houghton, Leeds (276). George loses 28 days remission in episode 230. Marie and Betty have tea at "Le Pierrot" (232). Marie's petition to have George freed has 6,842 signatures, including one she is particularly pleased with - a woman whose brother is married to a girl whose sister is married to the brother of an MP (238 ).

Marie uses estate agents "Menskips" when she puts number 10 up for sale (252). Mr Davis, a bus driver and potential buyer, was born on 10th October, and married on the 10th. His first boy was born on the 10th. Oh, and the bus he drives is number.......46. (267). Ultimately, he decides against buying (275). The bearded, un-named but frequently reappearing policeman is number 9536 (233). His call sign is "Charlie Romeo" (244). The magic rabbits include "Fluffytail" (276).


Flashbacks:

Short sequences from episode 210, in which Tommy tells Barry and Terry that they are about to become video nasties, then watches as they are beaten up, are repeated in episode 271.


Probably the best in-joke of the entire series:

In episode 227, Paul has decided on the firm of external contractors to which he is going to award a PetroChem contract, and Annabelle asks him if it is anyone she knows. "Oh, I shouldn't think so. Hardly household names. They've got a first class reputation in the business - WOODWARD and LYNCH."

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having found Tom's prototype DADI tachograph device amongst some junk near a discarded mattress, Heather asks him if he has invented anything else. He jokes that there is the Curzon Desert Submarine, which travels under sand, and is being considered by the Ministry of Defence, who will be starting desert warfare trials soon in Southport!
