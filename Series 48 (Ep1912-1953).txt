The storylines:

Jacqui has operations to restore her sight, gains Ron as a partner in "Bar Brookie", sees Leanne imprisoned for just three years, and turns down a marriage proposal by Ben. As one marriage begins - Rachel, God help her, weds Christian - another ends, as Bel leaves Ollie. But he soon begins a relationship with new arrival Eleanor, a solicitor who takes over the "Trading Post" premises, with Katie as her "Girl Friday", just as Mick and Elaine need to defend themselves against a murder charge, when Cassie reports them to the police after discovering they helped Gladys to die. Also still grieving, Max and Susannah come up with the idea of surrogacy when their hopes of having, or adopting, another child are dashed - but Jackie gives birth to a new baby, William, and while Lindsey is encouraged by Peter to "Sing Like A Star", Jimmy resolves to begin a new career of which his family can be proud, even though this may require a certain amount of forgery by Danny, who also makes brief forays into theft and joyriding with Tinhead. Sinbad hopes Tinhead can turn over a new leaf, and accept that he wants to move in with Carmel on a more permanent basis - but he may just have to rethink his plans.......

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, apart from a few scenes of episode 1924 in which Lindsey and Peter are in Manchester.

Births:

One - William James Corkhill is born in episode 1915, weighing 6lb 2oz (1915, 1917), and is six weeks old in episode 1931. We are also told that Kylie is 5 (1923); Danny is 15 (1927, 1934) / 14 (1945); Susannah is 37 (1926, 1944, 1949), and it was her birthday five months ago, just before the accident (1951); Jackie is older than Susannah (1935); Tinhead is 16 (1939, 1946); Max and Susannah are both under 40 (1942); Max is 37 (1944); Jacqui is 21 (1950); and Tanya is 15 (1951, 1952). Gladys's coffin plate indicates that she was aged 53 years when she died (1914) - but according to Cassie, she was 55 (1929)! One of Bel's certificates reveals that she was born on 22nd November 1952 (1925), and Jimmy's certificates show his date of birth as 14th November 1951 (1925, 1929) - not that they are necessarily an accurate reflection of his qualifications.......

Marriages:

One - Rachel Jordache marries Christian Wright in episode 1923, in a ceremony that is "a week away" in episode 1920 and "tomorrow" in episode 1922, and, based on dialogue in episode 1902, takes place on 26th July. It soon starts to look unlikely, however, that they will remain together as long as Bel and Ollie, who have been married for 25 years (1918, 1945). We are also told that Max and Susannah married in 1983 (1944).

Deaths:

None. It is five months (1944) / six months (1945) since Max and Susannah's children died. Gladys's coffin plate indicates that she died in July 1997 aged 53 years (1914), and we are told that she died on a Wednesday [early morning] (1916), although Mick and Elaine are accused of murdering her on 1st July 1997 [the Tuesday night] (1939). But there are many unseen and never-to-be-seen characters who are no longer alive, but are mentioned: Julia's husband, Arthur (1914, 1923, 1925); Jimmy's brother, Franky (1914, 1916); Jimmy's father, Albie (1914, 1916); Jimmy's uncles, Bernie (1914), Kenny (1914, 1916) and Wilfie (1916); Gladys's mother (1916); Ollie's father, one of his parents (1917); Jimmy's mother (1920); Lindsey's grandfather, William (1920); Julia's mother (1926); Dolly Sparrow's mother (1926); Detective Sergeant Anderson's mother, who died of cancer nearly 18 months ago (1934); Carmel's mother, who also died of cancer (1940); and Ben's father (1948).

Toilet visits:

Several - Jimmy (1919), Jacqui (1922), Carmel (1924 and 1945), Katie (1927), Sinbad (1930), Leanne, allegedly (1932), Julia (1941), and Lisa (1953). William fills his nappy in episodes 1933 and 1938, and Tanya wets herself while locked in a cupboard in episode 1952.

Mentioned, so far unseen, but bound to turn up one day: Christian's mother (1918, 1921, 1922).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Mandy / Mandy Jordache (1913, 1922, 1923, 1933, 1944 / 1953); Trevor Jordache (1913); "Renee" [Doreen] (1913, 1925, 1949); Rod (1913); Nat / Nat Simpson (1914, 1917, 1919, 1921, 1922 / 1940); Georgia / Georgia Simpson (1914, 1917, 1919, 1921, 1922, 1925 / 1918); Jean (1914, 1917, 1918); Matthew / Matt (1914, 1917, 1928, 1946, 1949 / 1941); Emily / Em (1914, 1917, 1928, 1946, 1949 / 1941); Little Jimmy (1914, 1915, 1919, 1930, 1938); Billy / William (1914, 1915, 1920, 1921, 1949 / 1916); Sheila (1915); Andrew (1917); Patricia (1918, 1924, 1925, 1926); Dolly Sparrow (1919, 1926); JC /JC Bradley (1921, 1923, 1929, 1932, 1936, 1939 / 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1935); Sinbad's mother, who he found when in his 30's (1922); Jack Sullivan (1923); Alice (1925, 1944); Eric (1926); DD (1928, 1930); Val (1933, 1940); Beth (1938); and Thomas (1944).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Tracey, petrol station worker (1916); Philip and Jonathan, old friends of Danny (1916); Claire B, who has written a letter to a problem page that Jacqui gets David to read to her (1917); Ollie's mother, one of his parents (1917); Mr Jameson of the cricket club in Fornby (1918); Jackie's mother (1918); Dolly Sparrow's cousin Mabel (1919); Mr Jackson, eye doctor (1924); Mary, the oldest of Dolly's seven siblings (1926); Cynthia Brown, a singing teacher Peter suggests Lindsey contacts (1928); Kim, a friend of Tanya (1929); Smudge, the lost cat belonging to an unnamed woman in the police station (1930); Chris, a currently "e-colied" old mate of Ollie (1930); Peter's mother (1938); Mr Elliott, a consultant (1940); Angela, a friend of Katie (1941); Tony, a stand-in chef (1942); Colin, a Round Table member with adoption agency contacts (1943); Danny's friend Michael, and his mother (1944); Thompson's brother (1944); Donnegan, Jimmy's tutor (1948); Phil Harvey, an old boyfriend of Susannah (1949); John, a television quiz contestant (1949); and Kenny Foster, Richard Everitt and Philip, boyfriends that Lisa and Susannah stole from each other (1953).

Goofs:

In episode 1922, Rachel pluralises the tenth word instead of the second or fourth: "The doctor just want to keep her in for observations"; and in episode 1938 she replaces "to" with an additional "for": "I just slipped next door for Katie's for a coffee.".

In episode 1929, Cassie describes her mother, Gladys, as "a 55-year-old woman" - but her coffin plate, seen in episode 1914, indicated that she was only 53 when she died.

Ollie is similarly wrong in episode 1945, referring to Danny as a 14-year old. Perhaps he has forgotten that his son has recently had his 15th birthday?

In episode 1926, the extracts Jimmy and Danny quote from the false CV are slightly / entirely inconsistent with what was seen briefly on-screen in episode 1925, and partly seen again in episode 1929. Jimmy says that he worked at the Woolongong Outdoor Pursuit Centre and the Melbourne Physical Activity Centre, and Danny says he worked for the London Borough of Forest Hall. But the CV actually reads as follows:

CHARACTER PROFILE
Based in Liverpool for most of my working life, I have experienced a wide range of employment, a great deal of which has been in the public service industries.

I have been a supporter of the local Round Table movement in the past.

Danny has presumably made further modifications to the CV by the time it is submitted to Michael Potter, the Course Director and Co-ordinating Tutor who interviews Jimmy for teacher-training in episode 1935, so that, with a certain grain of truth, it now mentions Jimmy's earlier work with "horses" (!) and "pharmaceuticals" (!!) which are briefly referred to at the interview.......

Trivia:

Julia claims that she used to look like Rita Hayworth from the back when she was younger (1949), and that when her grandson Rod was born, he was three weeks overdue (1913). She reassures Susannah by revealing that Mary, the first of eight children, was only born to Dolly Sparrow's mother nine years after she married (1926). Max has known Susannah for 14 years, according to Lisa, who has never married (1949), and hasn't eaten beef "ever since that BSE scare" (1953). He pays Â£5 to hire an erotic film called "Fields Of Fun" (1931), and is seen reading a letter he and Susannah have received regarding infertility counselling, which appears to be signed by "C. Kavanagh", and is from Liverpool General Hospital, Prescot Street, Liverpool L7 8XP, whose telephone and fax numbers are 0151 706 2000 and 0151 706 5806 (1945).

Lindsey receives a letter from "Sing Like A Star" inviting her to attend an audition at studios in Replay Street, Manchester on a date in July 1997 (1926). Jimmy, whose uncle Kenny got fifteen years for armed robbery (1916), implies that he and Jackie conceived her on their honeymoon, which was three days in Rhyl (1927). Although Jimmy cannot swim (1925), he is interviewed for a job at the swimming pool at Manor Park Sports Centre (1926); and, although he has no "O" or "A" levels (1928), he is assigned to class 10B for his teacher-training placement (1944). He receives a grant cheque for Â£1,500.10, but Jackie has to give Ollie a cheque for Â£185 for books that Danny stole from the branch of Elton's Bookshop that he manages (1950). Jimmy, who is seen consulting "The SAS Survival Handbook" by John "Lofty" Wiseman as he prepares for a school field trip (1952), was doing time for GBH ten years ago, according to Sinbad (1929), whose shop burglar alarm code is now 1234 [instead of the once embarrassingly forgettable number it was previously!!] (1949).

Bel, who has moved to a flat in Fornby (1945), attended Skelmersdale Gramnmar School, and passed six "O" levels with "The Examining Board of Great Britain" in summer 1968. According to his certificate from Sheffield University, dated 8th July 1970, Ollie has a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours, Class II Division I, having followed an approved Honours programme in Sociology, minoring in American Studies (1931). He also claims to have a Woodwork "O" level (1920); he recalls paying Â£42,000 for the house on the Close (1918); he is seen carrying some books, including one entitled "British Economy and Social History" (1948); and he suggests to Eleanor - "Eleanor J. Kitson, Solicitor" as she is described on the repainted window of the "Trading Post" (1949, 1953) - that they go to see a play called "The Ale House" (1941).

At the scrapyard at which Ron finds the "Moby", there is a bulldozer bearing the name "Lyons Bros" and the outdated telephone number 051 220 5163 (1914). About to go into hospital, Jacqui asks Katie if she has packed her "Marie-Claire" magazines (1926). Jacqui's mother is scared of flying (1940). Leanne appears in Court Four (1934), and is sentenced to three years' imprisonment (1937, 1938). Tinhead has frosties for his breakfast (1949), and claims that he was shoplifting when he was "about 7" (1943). "Amazing Grace" and "Sing Low, Sweet Chariot" are sung at the funeral of Gladys (1914), who loved carnations (1926). She received Â£48,000 for the sale of her house, her legal and funeral expenses are Â£2,000, and she has made a bequest of Â£10,000 to Tanya, receivable when she is 18. This leaves Â£36,000 to be split equally between Cassie and Elaine/Mick, who have already had Â£17,500 of their share, and only get Â£500 more (1921). Cassie is seen getting out of a taxi bearing the name "Manor Cabs" and the telephone number 269 6699 (1930).

Christian has a "Manic Street Preachers" poster on the back of the door to his flat (1929, 1930, 1936, 1945, 1948, 1949); Eleanor has art by Ansel Adams on the wall of her new office (1935, 1936, 1950); and the lorry seen crashing at the end of episode 1953 bears the name "Walter Howard", the address 12 Clifford Road, Southport, and the telephone number 01704 545926. Jimmy is left-handed (1942, 1944, 1946, 1947), while Dr Miller (1912), Rachel (1915), Katie (1917, 1921), Jacqui (1917), Eleanor (1919, 1945), Danny (1922), Ron (1925, 1928, 1938), Ollie (1932), the Clerk of the Court (1934), all three of the magistrates before which Elaine and Mick appear (1939), Detective Sergeant Anderson (1943), and Max (1943), are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

All of this season's "moments" relate to Bel, strangely enough. Firstly, her letter to Danny in episode 1913, which is torn up by Ollie, but later pieced back together, reads as follows:

Dear Daniel, I don't want you to be worried or upset, but I have to go away for a few days to stay with friends. I will be in touch with you as soon as possible. Please don't worry. Love you lots. Mum xxx

Secondly, as she arrives for her appointment at the "clap clinic", she is wearing sunglasses - almost certainly in the hope of avoiding recognition if anyone she knows sees her (1915) !

And thirdly, her maiden name is never ever mentioned by her or by any other character - but it appears on her "O" levels certificate, seen very briefly as a computer scan on-screen which Danny then adapts for Jimmy, in episode 1925.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

While Elaine is telling Mick that she is about to go on the run with Tania rather than face trial, and wants him to come with her, and Max and Susannah are asking Lisa whether she would be willing to act as a surrogate mother for them, Tinhead is in the front garden of his home, trying to impress his friend Sharon by launching some stolen fireworks through an equally stolen section of piping. After one of them just misses the telephone box across the road at which it was aimed, he lights another - and nothing happens. Until some seconds later, just as a lorry is driving past! The firework hits its windscreen, and the flash temporarily blinds the driver, who swerves off the road, through the O'Learys' fence and into their garden. As Tinhead and Sharon run out of the way to avoid being hit, the lorry crashes through the window and wall of the front room - where Tinhead had left his young sister Melanie watching television.......
