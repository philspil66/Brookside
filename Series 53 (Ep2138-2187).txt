The appearances of Tim O'Leary and Jason Shadwick in episode 2168, and of Luke Musgrove in episode 2172, are only in flashbacks from episode 2153.

The Channel Four broadcasts of episodes 2178, 2179, 2183, 2184 and 2185 were followed by trailers for "Brookie Basics", and the closing music in these episodes is much shorter than usual, with the cast and production credits presented in two columns in a much smaller font size.

The storylines:

Baby Emma comes into the world, and young Susan Clarke leaves it. Mick has an affair with another married woman, is lumbered with long-lost nephew Jerome, and buys Gemma a hamster. Mike, Tim and Leo all have their eyes on the younger females on the Close, and although Jackie is concerned that her husband may be tempted away from her, it's actually Margi who ought to have those worries....... Having kicked both their husbands out for infidelity, Lindsey and Susannah join forces in the new "Millennium Club" venture with Jacqui, whose surrogacy deal is finally revealed to all. But so is Ron's unfaithfulness of eighteen years earlier, as the arrival of his secret daughter Megan, and the brief return of his former partner Bev, wreck his plans to marry Anthea - at least temporarily. And life is not going well for the Musgroves - Niamh's admission that she cannot read leads to her demotion at work, Joey faces being blackmailed over drink-driving, and Luke is held on remand when Nikki believes he is responsible for drug-raping her at a Christmas party. But there are many other possible suspects - has she identified her real attacker?

The dates:

Joey's court date, according to the summons seen in episode 2146, is Wednesday 9th December 1998 - so, as his court appearance is "tomorrow" in episode 2147 and takes place in episode 2148, it is Tuesday 8th December 1998 and Wednesday 9th December 1998 respectively in these episodes. In the latter episode, the accident seen in episode 2137 is revealed to have taken place on 13th November 1998. It is Wednesday 23rd December 1998, then 24th December, in episode 2153, and it is Christmas Day in episode 2154, based on dialogue in these episodes and later references to their events in episodes 2155, 2158, 2173 and 2177. It will soon be 1999, according to dialogue in episode 2156, and it is New Year's Eve, then New Year's Day 1999, in episode 2157. It is Friday in episode 2160; it is 12/01/1999, and the "National Year of Reading", in episode 2161; and, based on dialogue in episodes 2164 and 2165, it is Friday in episode 2165 (in which a January 1999 calendar can be seen) and Saturday in episode 2166. Based on dialogue in episodes 2168 and 2170, it is/was Friday in episode 2169; and, based on dialogue in episodes 2170 and 2171, it is Friday again in episode 2172. Based on dialogue in episodes 2174, 2175 (in which it is Valentine's Night) and 2177, it is Tuesday 16th February in episode 2176 and Wednesday 17th February in episode 2177. Based on a newspaper feature seen in episode 2174 indicating that 15th-19th February is "National Chip Week", which Mick says is "starting soon", episode 2178 takes place on one of those dates. March 10th is "two weeks" away in episode 2180; it is Friday in episode 2181; and it is Mothers Day in episode 2187. Nikki's NUS card, which she finds in Harvey's wallet in episode 2185, is dated 1998/99.

Locations:

Virtually all of the action in this season takes place in or near Liverpool, the only exceptions being a few scenes in Lisa's flat in Chester, not necessarily recorded there, in episode 2140; and a few scenes in the Regency Hotel, Manchester, in episode 2162.

Births:

One - After being six months pregnant (2138) / eight months pregnant (2154), Susannah gives birth to Emma in episode 2165, four weeks before she was due (2165, 2168). It is the day she was actually due in episode 2181. Anthea reveals that she was seven months pregnant (2150) when she married Geoff, who was about fifteen years older than her (2148). It is Sinbad's 42nd birthday in episode 2167, it has been Katie's birthday recently in episode 2178, and it is Mick's birthday - "tomorrow" in episode 2183 - in episode 2184.

Luke's date of birth, captioning police photographs of him in episode 2161, is 10/03/1978, and it is his 21st birthday, which is "next week" in episode 2183 and "tomorrow" in episode 2185, in episode 2186. The unseen Irene Hennessey was 44 when Peter was 17 (2144); DS Rose's unseen daughter is Nikki's age (2156); and Sammy's never-to-be seen husband is 45 (2158). Less accurately, Leo guesses that Susannah is "about 50" in episode 2147.

We are also told that Lindsey is 26 (2141); Jackie is 44 (2144) / twenty years older than Bev, according to Bev (2153); Megan is 18 (2147, 2150, 2152) and was born in 1980 (2147); Susan is 14 (2150) / is 15 (2153) / was 14 (2160); Harry is three months old (2151) / three and a half months old (2154) / four months old (2168); Leo is 17 (2153) / nearly 18 (2184); Nikki is 19 (2155, 2179); Jason is 19 (2155); Matt is 17 (2156); Tim is 18 (2156, 2177); Kelly is 15 (2160); Gemma is 13 (2166); William is 20 months old (2180); Ron is older than Jackie (2180); and Jerome is 19 (2185); and in episode 2180 Anthea and Ron are both said to be "nearly 50" [but see "Goofs" below].

Marriages:

One - Lindsey Stanlow, nee Corkhill, marries Peter Phelan in episode 2138. We are also told in episodes 2146 and 2151 that Sammy is marrying a rich bloke in the Seychelles at Christmas - and Katie returns, having been to that wedding, in episode 2158. Ron and Anthea plan to marry "next month" (2166) / "in a few weeks" (2166) / "next Tuesday" (2174) - but Megan intervenes to prevent this from happening when "any known impediments" are asked for (2176). Niamh says that she and Joey will have been married for 25 years "in a few years' time" (2171); and Margi and Greg have been together for 23 years (2181) / 20-odd years (2182).

Deaths:

Two - we discover in episode 2153 that Betty McLoughlin, Bev's mother, died earlier in the year, of undisclosed causes; and in episode 2159 we learn that Susan Clarke has died of a drug overdose. We are also reminded that Tony died four years ago (2148); and the following unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters are mentioned: Jimmy's brother Franky, who died of a knife wound (2143); Mick's mother (2146); Geoff (2148, 2150, 2151), Megan's Welsh father (2146), who died four years ago (2149), when Megan was 13 (2148); Helen / Alec's wife / Niamh's mother (2147 / 2174 / 2179), who died aged 34 (2179); Joey's drunken English father (2147); Joey's mother, who walked out when he was young (2147); Anthea's mother (2152); Frank (2172, 2183) / Leo's uncle (2172) / Jerome's father (2173, 2183, 2185) / Mick's cousin (2174) - whose funeral the Johnsons go to in episode 2173; Susannah's grandmother, who was called Emma (2180); and Greg's father (2182).

Toilet visits:

Before Katrina (2146), Luke (2148), Megan (2149), and Jerome (2184) step up (or sit down), Matt breaks "Brookside"'s speed-peeing record in episode 2139, with a remarkable seven-second performance against a wall - although Ryan inspects the output later on in the same episode, and isn't impressed!

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Rose [Gannon] (2142, 2148, 2162) / Luke's aunt (2142, 2146) / Joey's sister (2162); Katrina's father (2143, 2146, 2150, 2155, 2159); Katrina's mother (2155, 2187); Rose [Finnegan]'s baby (2157); Susannah's mother (2181, 2186), who lives "down south" (2181); and Devvo, a mate of Jerome (2183).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Ellie, Luke's ex-girlfriend (2138); Laura Mulvaney, Kelly's friend (2142); Beryl Jones, a neighbour who lived opposite Niamh (2142); Niamh's two brothers (2142, 2179); Lorraine, Benny's wife (2142), and their son (2146); Mrs Winter, a salon customer (2142); Ronnie Bryan, an old mate of Peter (2143); Peter's mother (2144); Irene and Stan Hennessey, a hairdresser and her husband Peter once knew (2144); Salty, a friend of Leo (2147); Sharon and Laura, friends of Megan, and Brenda, Sharon's mother (2148); Clive, Jo's husband / Annabella's father (2149, 2153 / 2158); the Gordons, a family Katrina worked for in the USA last year (2150), and their three under-fives (2143); Susan's father (2150, 2153); Mrs Jennings, Emily's science teacher (2152); Ross's wife (2153); Katrina's auntie (2155); Brian, Mandy's new man (2156, 2160, 2185); Barry's wife and kids (2157); Pippa, a posh friend of Gemma (2158, 2159, 2179, 2182, 2183); Pippa's father (2158); Lucinda, Pippa's mother (2159); Clark, a schoolboy (2159); Sandra (2160), Marie Davies (2169), and Pat Harvey (2173), EasyLec employees (2160); Julie Todd, a raped friend of Margi (2161); Mrs Collins (2163), Mrs Fearon (2166), Mrs Carroll (2166), Mrs Douglas (2169) and Mrs Harrington (2172, 2177, 2180, 2181) / Lil (2177), "Great Grannies" customers; Nancy (2166), Beryl Scott (2169), and Mabel Lewis (2181), "Great Grannies"; Timpson, one of Nikki's lecturers (2167, 2181); Julie, a student on Nikki's course (2167); Mr Gordon (2167, 2175, 2182), Niamh's former boss who had a stroke at the age of 58 and is now in a nursing home (2167); Colin, to whom Benny and Joey report (2170); Carl, a friend of Leo (2172); Karina and Joel, mates of Kelly, and Maria, who isn't speaking to her (2175); Jane Malcolm, from Emily's biology class (2175); Ewen, who Rachel has been out with recently (2179); Tim's auntie Angie (2179); Lawson, one of Nikki and Bernie's lecturers (2183); Mr Parry and Mr Jacobs, clients of Mr Carlton (2183); and Vonnie's sister in London (2183).

Goofs:

In episode 2148, Megan replaces "was" with "wasn't": "All my life, I've believed the man who brought me up wasn't my dad."; and in episode 2149, Anthea replaces "of" with a second "as": "I suppose it was as much as a shock to you two.".

In episode 2152, Niamh seems to be missing out a comma: "I've waited a long time for this love."; and in episode 2180, Bev's assessment of Anthea's age - "She's nearly 50" - may well be accurate, but Ron's reply - "So am I" - is not. He celebrated his 50th birthday in episode 1990, the Christmas before last!

Based on other references to Luke's birthday on 10th March and its arrival in episode 2186, the Friday on which it is Mick's birthday in episode 2184 must be 5th March - contradicting episode 902, in which it was clearly established that it is 12th March!

Trivia:

Lisa did not speak to Susannah for two years after she became engaged to Max (2140), whose affair with Faye has lasted for twenty years (2138, 2144) - which is the same length of time that Niamh has had her present job (2164, 2170, 2173, 2184, 2185) at EasyLec, which has other branches in Bolton and Altrincham (2167). Joey, who is from Limerick (2147), once worked at EasyLec too, but was sacked (2175). He is fined £500, payable at the rate of £25 per week, for being under the influence of excessive alcohol (2158) while driving taxi number 1223 (2146). Luke was born in Liverpool, but grew up in Ireland (2156), living with his aunt in Dublin until he was 12 (2146). He works at a car wash in Johnson Street, having previously spent a summer working in Torquay (2146), and is held on remand at H.M.P. Altcourse (2176). The card he holds while being photographed reads "NAME: LUKE MUSGROVE DATE: 12/01/1999 D.O.B. 10/03/1978 PHOTO NO. 46213 AT MANOR PARK POLICE STATION" (2161). Alec works at, and gets Joey an interview at, "Post Haste" (2183, 2184); and Benny's local pub is "The Pear Tree" (2158).

Greg and Margi are seeing in the New Year at "St Andrew's Club" (2157). Greg, whose full name is Gregory Antony Shadwick (2168), and who used to work at "Laird's" (2152), was not at the births of any of his children (2165) - nor were any of them breast-fed (2171). His fly-tipper, Stevie Dobson, is from Merce Lane (2155). Jessie has been shopping at Asda (2152), and Ross is the Regional Industrial Officer (2152). Gemma, who now goes to "Heathbank" school (2149, 2156) is seen reading a book called "Are You Experienced" by William Sutcliffe (2158). Jerome has four "A" levels (2173) - and so has Megan (2149), who is a computer software analyst, and a vegetarian (2149). She, Anthea and Geoff were a family for 14 years (2150). John is the son of Anthea's cousin (2173), and a part-time stripper (2178, 2179). Anthea Sarah Brindley (2176) recalls meeting Ronald William Dixon (2176) at Birds' Eye (2177). Bev is fined £50, payable at a rate of £5 per week, for shoplifting (2166), and Josh has been in care since the end of August (2153) / for five months (2169).

While awaiting Lindsey's arrival, Mrs Loughton reads "The People's Friend" (2138); and the vicar has a commitment at the "Ring O' Bells" pub after the wedding (2138). Lindsey discovers by dialling 1471 that Peter has called her from 0161 289 5317, which she rings and finds to be the Regency Hotel, Manchester (2161). He was cautioned by the police in 1983 when caught in a stolen Triumph Stag with a glue-sniffer who later died (2143). Kylie is playing "Mary" in her school nativity play (2146), and Jackie finds at the Simpsons' the book "The Ultimate Guide to Sex" by Karen Jones (2161). Andy trained in Fine Art, but has worked in graphic design since leaving college (2172), and Karen's university thesis was on the Balkan Wars (2165), while Katie is currently finishing a GNVQ in Business Administration (2181). On New Year's Eve, 279 applications are received for membership of the health club (2157); and among Max's belongings, Ron finds a framed certificate: "Mersey Night Out - Best Restaurant on Merseyside - Awarded to "Grants", Spring 1996" (2142).

The "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's" and the telephone number 0151 629 1676 is still outside the Simpsons' in episodes 2151, 2153 and 2166. The telephone number 0151 269 5941 is seen again on Greg's van in episodes 2139, 2149, 2151, 2167 and 2182; the telephone numbers on the "Harlow Marquees" van seen in episode 2156 are 01565 830468 and 01744 26456; and the telephone number of "Goldline Taxis" is 0151-269-9696 (2138, 2139, 2142, 2146, 2149, 2151, 2153, 2170). A skip bearing the name "CRS SKIP HIRE" and the telephone number 0151 424 2397 can be seen in episode 2148. A similarly-worded "Great Grannies" flier to the one originally seen in episode 2090 reappears in episode 2183, when it can be seen that it ends "So ring 'Great Grannies' Agency now on 0151 269 5341" - and the same telephone number appears below the logo "Great Grannies Agency" and the slogan "There when you need them" on the shop sign, seen in episode 2184.

There are posters of "X Files" (2143), the Beatles (2147), Oasis (2148) and Supergrass (2148) in Leo and Tim's garage, a "Travis" poster on the wall of Mike's flat (2148), posters of "Romeo and Juliet" and "Titanic" on the wall of Emily's bedroom (2152), posters of the "Spice Girls" on the walls of Gemma's bedroom (2153), and a poster of George Clooney on the wall of Nikki's bedroom (2153, 2165, 2174). Art by Claude Monet (2145, 2l58) and Ansel Adams (2145, 2147) still hangs in the solicitors' office, and a painting captioned "Night Terrors" by Susan Clarke, 9C, has been on display in a classroom at Brookside Comprehensive (2152). Alec (2142), Ron (2144, 2174), Lindsey (2145, 2148, 2161, 2180), a waitress (2149), Susannah (2158), Ryan (2168, 2183), Tina (2169), Mick (2169), Margi (2173), Anthea (2173, 2183), Luke (2173), D.S. Rose (2176), Gemma (2182), Katie (2183) and Jackie (2186) are all right-handed, while Jimmy (2153, 2184), David Seaman (2157), a desk officer (2159), and Nathan (2161) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

From episode 2147, here's one from the file marked "He won't be saying that in a few years' time".......

Quote:

LEO: Emily Shadwick?
TIM: Seven.......and a half.
LEO: Is that all?
TIM: She is missing one vital component. Or two, actually.
LEO: What's that?
TIM: She's not exactly Dolly Parton, is she?
LEO: No, I suppose not.

In the following extract from episode 2159, Katrina is lying about what she said to Susannah in her earlier interview - asked by Susannah what made her want to come home from America in episode 2150, her reply is "My father was taken ill.":

Quote:

SUSANNAH: There's just one thing I'm not quite clear about, though.
KATRINA: Oh yeah, what?
SUSANNAH: Well, there seems to be a gap that wasn't accounted for at the end of 1996.
KATRINA: When I was in America?
SUSANNAH: Mm. You said in your interview that you came home due to your father's illness. But it says here that you left due to the illness of the child's father.
KATRINA: Oh, you must have misheard me. I said the baby's dad.
SUSANNAH: Really?
KATRINA: Yeah, he was so ill he had to get the baby's grandparents to come and stay. And so he decided it would be better if I left, as there really wasn't any room for me. And, to be honest, I was starting to feel a bit homesick by then anyway.
SUSANNAH: Oh, I see. Well, okay.


Katrina's claim in episode 2150 that the American family have since moved, and are therefore probably unable to provide references, also gives the strong - but ultimately entirely mistaken! - impression that there is some dark secret in her past......

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Her parents are both out doing more important things elsewhere - Greg has nipped next door to go to bed with Susannah, and Margi is busy beating up Emily's athletics coach - so Nikki is alone at home in the bungalow. Until Ryan gains entry through the unlocked patio doors.......she pleads with him not to hurt her, as he blames her for Luke being held in custody, tells her that she should think twice about speaking up at his trial, and reminds her that he was only one of many men who saw her drunk, and acting like a slag, at the party. "Whatever you got that night, you more than asked for it. Open your mouth too wide, and I'll be the one sorting things out next time.......
