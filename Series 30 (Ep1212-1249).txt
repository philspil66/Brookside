The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard again in episodes 1222, when Leo and Gemma are watching; in episode 1239, when Matthew, Emily and Thomas are watching; and again in episode 1243, when DD is watching, and the creatures themselves are also seen again. DD is also seen watching "Meadowcroft Park" in episode 1239, when a young male character, probably "Tarquin Tully", is seen and heard on her television screen, followed by an "End of part one" graphic.

The storylines:

Last minute hitches prevent the weddings of Sinbad and Marcia and of Ellis and Marianne. But Marianne is soon proposed to again - this time by Mick, whose move into the flat above the pizza parlour allows the Crosbies to buy his bungalow on the Close. Elsewhere, Peter's household grows to include Anna, Mike and Keith, as does Frank's, with the arrival of Lyn's family and her younger sister Bev, with whom Ron is rapidly smitten. Max clashes with Patricia and Susannah over plans to take Matthew and Emily to America for a year, Terry beomes the manager of the garage, and Diana leaves the Close, her successors at number 10 being new arrivals the Jordaches. And while the younger daughter, Rachel, will still be around for many years and more than 600 appearances, the same cannot be said for her father, Trevor. Recently released from prison after beating up wife Mandy and raping elder daughter Beth, his behaviour since tracking them down at their latest "safe house" leads them to the terrible conclusion that they will have to kill him. But can this really be as good a plan, or as easy to carry out, as they think?

The dates:

In episode 1212 it is St Jacqueline's Day, and it is Valentine's Day next week. Based on dialogue in episode 1219, it was Monday in episode 1218; and in episode 1224, Wednesday is "No Smoking" Day. It is Monday in episode 1227, Wednesday in episode 1228, and Mothers' Day later in the week in both of these episodes. It is Friday in episode 1232; it is March in episode 1233, according to a calendar; and it is Easter next week in episodes 1235 and 1236. Based on dialogue in episode 1236, it was Friday in episode 1235; it is Good Friday in episode 1238; it is a bank holiday in episode 1239; and it is the Nineties in episode 1240.

Locations:

DD and Ron are seen in various places in Blackpool in episode 1221, and inside the hotel in which they are staying there in episodes 1222 and 1223, in scenes that may or may not have been recorded in Blackpool. There is one brief establishing shot that is recognisably Blackpool in the latter episode, but none in the former. Otherwise, the furthest away from Liverpool that anyone gets in this season is Southport - in episode 1241, Ron and Bev are seen in the foyer, the restaurant and room 21 of the hotel in which they are staying.

Births:

None. It is Mick's birthday in episode 1226, and it is Rachel's 14th birthday in episode 1233. We are also told that Katie is 16 (1217); Mike is 19 (1219), then 20 (1240) / over 18 (1220); Beth is 17 (1220, 1232, 1238); Peter is 25, according to Anna (1222); Barry is 30-ish, according to Ron (1223); Bev is 21 (1234, 1238, 1240); DD is younger than Ron (1234), who has only just turned 40 (1244) and is older than Frank (1246); and either Matthew or Emily is 6 (1243).

Marriages:

None - although two are planned for next Wednesday (1212, 1213), neither go ahead. We are told that DD and Ron have been married for 20 years (1218, 1226, 1232, 1233, 1243), and so have Mandy and Trevor (1229) - it is their 20th wedding anniversary in episode 1243 / "on Wednesday" in episode 1242.

Deaths:

None - despite how it may look, not even Trevor in episode 1249. This completes the longest run of consecutive episodes from 21 years of "Brookside" in which no characters die at all - 134 in a row. The only unseen dead character mentioned in this season is Frank's father (1221).

Toilet visits:

Sinbad (1213); Ron (1224); Beth (1228); Frank (1228); Bev (1229 and 1248); a man (1231); Matthew and Emily (1240); and Trevor (1249). Ron's visit in episode 1224 is noteworthy in that he shatters the speed record held by Mike since episode 887, emerging from the "Trading Post" a mere 21 seconds after going in specifically for that purpose. It has taken him longer than that to convince DD to cover for him in his absence!

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but sure to turn up at some point:

Winnie / Marianne's mother (1215 / 1218, 1227, 1231); and Lyn's ex-husband, Steve (1216, 1221, 1224 - when he is unseen while driving away from the Close after visiting!, 1229, 1245, 1246, 1247 / 1230).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Derek (1212, 1214, 1215, 1217, 1219, 1222, 1223, 1224, 1226, 1227, 1228, 1229, 1230, 1231, 1233, 1238); Fran (1212, 1216, 1223); Steven (1212, 1216); the Harrisons / Peter's parents (1215, 1218, 1226 / 1232, 1234, 1235, 1240), including John Harrison / Peter's father (1215 / 1218); Rod (1215); Chrissy / Katie's mother (1216, 1217, 1218, 1229 / 1220, 1221); Sammy (1217, 1220, 1245); Jackie Corkhill (1218, 1238); Ron's father (1219); The Shackletons (1221, 1231, 1235, 1236, 1238, 1244, 1245, 1246, 1248), including Mr Shackleton (1226, 1246); Sue (1223); "Growler" / Geoff (1223); Geoffrey [Fletcher] (1225); and Karen [Grant] (1226).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Tony, now Josie's ex again (1212, 1213, 1214); Max's parents (1214); Marianne's grandmother (1215); Helga, a radio contact of David (1219); Jessica, Mike's girlfriend (1219); Mrs Bond, Ron and DD's honeymoon landlady (1221); "Desperate" Danny Cole, stand-in bingo-caller at the Legion (1221); Mrs Blake, who is having her hair done at 3.00 on Thursday (1223); Keith's mother (1227); Susie, a friend of Rachel, and her mother (1230); Anna's parents (1234); Dennis Beresford, a client of Patricia (1243); and Helen, another friend of Rachel (1249).

Goofs:

Max's second and third words seem to be in the wrong order in episode 1215: "He's still not messing around....".

In episode 1234, the number plates of the police car parked outside the bungalow are J314 FCA.......until it is seen driving away, when the rear plate becomes J196 EDM !

Trivia:

The Jordaches once lived in Bexton Avenue (1231, 1235), and, according to Trevor, had some marvellous holidays in Spain (1243). Mandy had Trevor, who was a building society manager (1242), sent to prison two years ago (1221). She had previously given him a watch inscribed "Tick Tock, Trev's Clock" (1235). Beth, who is right-handed (1220), is doing "A" levels (1238, 1248), including Biology (1230), at FE college (1220).

According to DD, Ron's idea of foreplay is checking to see if she is awake first (1224). Their honeymoon, which took place in August (1221), was two nights spent in Blackpool (1218); and they play "Trivial Pursuit" with Lyn and Frank in episode 1217. Mike is in his second year at John Moores University (1221). He and Beth go bowling with Keith, who has been to Tenerife (1220), and Margaret, whose mother's phone number begins with 061 (1212), at "Hollywood Bowl" (1228).

Bev, whose last boyfriend was a brickie from Hyton (1232), lives at number 56 (1228). She is the only aunt (1228) of Gavin Ian Matthews, whose nickname at school, based on his initials, is GIM / Gimme (1223), and Alison, who goes to school in Speke (1243). Katie has a poster of Jason Donovan on her bedroom wall (1221).

The telephone number of Ellis Peter Johnson (1216), when dialled by Mick, would appear to be 734 5113 (1221). The telephone number on their pizza van, 051 269 3434, is seen again in episodes 1220 and 1231. Marianne Alannah Dwyer's hotel room is number 666 (1216).
