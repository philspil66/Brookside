The storylines:

This season includes the debut of Tim "Tinhead" O'Leary, who will still be around at the very end of the series more than seven years later; and the departure of the Banks family. Patricia also leaves Max again, and goes to live with Jean in France - but he rapidly acquires another family, as Susannah, Matthew and Emily move back in with him. Sinbad is not short of female company either, gaining both Jackie's sister Val and Peter's sister Fee as girlfriends, and opening a shop on the Parade. Jacqui's salon wins an award, Sammy begins to neglect Louise, and Jackie and Jimmy get back together after he makes a real effort to make an honest living for once. Lindsey and Mike are both eventually released from their Thailand jail, and plan to marry, once Jackie has convinced her daughter not to go back to Gary. And Mick becomes obsessed with body-building, and starts taking steroids, which affect his moods and cause conflict with new arrivals, the Simpsons. Ollie's wife Bel has lost her job, meaning that the family have to move to a much smaller home, and can no longer afford to send younger son Danny to grammar school, just as the wedding of older son Nat to his insipid fiancee Jules is approaching. However, the rest of the family do not know something that some of their new neighbours accidentally discover - Nat is secretly having an incestuous relationship with his sister, Georgia.......

Births:

None. It is Sammy's 24th birthday today in episode 1740, and it is Gemma's birthday in episode 1751.

Goofs:

Lindsey's second, third and fourth words are in the wrong order in episode 1721: "Mike's all out there on his own.".

Val says she has no children in episode 1737, contradicting dialogue from episode 1169 in which Jackie mentioned that she had.

Max omits "or" in episode 1738: "This is my house, and one way another I'm gonna get in".

Sammy omits "over-" in episode 1740: "After this -55's do......."

Mick's second and third words are in the wrong order in episode 1745: "I just won't be knocking on doors.".

Bel pluralises an extra word in episode 1748: "On some diplomatics relations course".

Susannah's meaning is clear, but her words are garbled, in episode 1759: "If we don't get a move on, we'll have all jammed up at the M5 junction".

Val is torn between "about" and "to do with" in episode 1760: "Was it anything to do about Mick attacking that posh bloke opposite you?".

Trivia:

The Banks' sale raises £107.43 (1717). On the caricature Lee draws of then, he dates the lottery cheque "11 October 1995" (1719). The sign outside number 9 in episodes 1719, 1720, 1721 and 1722 names their estate agents as "Haskayne Brimstage", and bears the telephone number 0151 269 4000. The removals van which arrives to collect what remains of their furniture in episode 1720 bears the name "A.J LEWIS, REMOVALS" and the telephone number 0151 420 4433. The auctioneer, who reveals that the "PT" marking on David's statue does not mean that it was sculpted by "Paran Tatang", but was actually manufactured in Port Talbot, is from Russell Jenkins & Co, Residential & Commerical Surveys and Valuations, whose telephone number is 0151 692 6149 (1725). The same number is also shown, above 0802 800035, in Jimmy's telephone book, and is called by Jackie to reach Big Davey, in episode 1742 - and it had also previously been Bev's friend Janice's telephone number in episode 1613!! The house is sold to the Simpsons for £45,000 (1725), and a "SOLD" banner has been added to the sign when it is seen again in episode 1726.

Ollie's daily newspaper is the "Guardian" (1733); his middle initial is "J", so he had the name "O.J. Simpson" long before someone else did (1740); and he is the manager of a branch of "Elton's Books" (1728). Bel used to be the Soft Furnishings buyer at "Niven's" (1728, 1746, 1748, 1756), and is offered (1746), then no longer offered (1748), a job in the fabric department of "Millards" (1742, 1746, 1748). Ollie and Bel met at university (1730); Ollie was late for his wedding after his stag night, which was three days in Dublin (1752); and they moved to Fornby from Brighton six years ago (1728). Their removalists are J Hebblewhite, Removals and Storage, telephone 01704 951674 (1726). JC has ordered matching rings for Nat and Jules, his only daughter (1758), from "Falconer and Carr's" (1758). Nat, who is in the second year of his degree (1730), and is studying architecture (1729, 1744) / the Bauhaus movement (1739), is marrying Jules at St Michael's church (1756), after knowing her for six months (1730) - but he has has been having a sexual relationship for six years (1759) with his sister, Georgia, who he joins in room 9 on his wedding night (1763). Danny reads a "Judge Dredd" comic, which is taken from him by Tinhead (1731), who lives on the Croft Park estate (1762).

Max's middle initial is "G" (1718), and he had a Mini when he originally courted Susannah (1760). He won a Geography prize in November 1975, but failed his "O" level in that subject (1718), and his daily newspaper is the "Independent", until Susannah changes the order to a tabloid (1738). The clothes and wine she donates for auction raise a total of £211 for charity (1751), and the flat into which he briefly moves is number 4 (1736). The grammar school Matthew and Emily used to go to was "Priory Court" (1758). A comment written on Emily's school report appears to be signed by "A. Gray" (1758). Mick left school at the age of 16 (1734), and is seen carrying boxes of "Tolona" pizza cases again in episodes 1755 and 1761. The poster seen on the wall of the gym in episode 1737 promoting the "Workout Challenge" and "Novices Competition" mentions Cara and Jo at Reception, from whom application forms can be obtained.

Sinbad's shop sign bears his full name, Thomas Henry Edward Sweeney (1727, 1729). The plague reading "In loving memory of Sue and Danny Sullivan, who died tragically at this spot 4th October 1991" erected in episode 1636, is seen again on the Parade in episode 1721. A Fletchers' "Office To Let" sign, with the out-of-date telephone number 051 676 8666, can also still be seen in the background in episodes 1730, 1745 and 1750. The hair fayre is sponsored by Michael Mirquin International Hair Products (1745, 1748, 1754). At the beginning of episode 1719, a fax is seen arriving from the House of Commons, London, SW1A 1AA, addressed to Mr Ron Dixon at fax number 0151 724 9513. It reads: "I have just received confirmation that James Payne MP has secured the release of one British National. The flight bound for England leaves Bangkok National Airport at ??.?? hrs local time. I will be sending an official car to take you to the airport in time to meet the flight.".

Sammy used to be the Functions Manager of the "Darlington" in Southport (1731), and Jimmy, who briefly gets a job at the "Pacific Star" pub (1728), was in prison for three months (1720). Lindsey was in prison for six weeks (1722); Mike was in prison for three months (1733, 1734); and, after being released, they look at rings, and decide on tattoos, at David M Robinson, jewellers (1751). Among the books that Ron planned to take to Mike in prison were "The World According To Garp" by John Irving, and "The Long Walk To Freedom" by Nelson Mandela (1732). Mike has "Reservoir Dogs" posters on his wall (1761). Gary's flat, into which Lindsey temporarily moves, is number 4 (1734), and a taxi he is seen driving in episode 1743 bears the name "Maple Cars" and the telephone number 692 5617. A florists' van bringing flowers from Jimmy for Jackie in the same episode bears the telephone number 269 0815. Macca is not married, has no children, and rents a flat (1757). Jimmy (1729, 1733) and Mike (1760) are both left-handed, while Rachel (1719), Kylie (1720), Lindsey (1724), Katie (1726, 1756), Val (1731), Danny (1733), Sinbad (1734), Max (1741, 1745, 1747), Jackie (1744), Bel (1752, 1755), JC (1756) and Bennet (1756) are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

While he apologises for the mess in the flat to Nat, Georgia and Jules in episode 1737, Max picks up a pair of discarded underpants and puts them into his pocket.

Right at the beginning of episode 1751, this must surely be young Emily Farnham's finest moment:

Quote:
EMILY: Mum, what's cop-ul-at-ion?

SUSANNAH: Um, er....... Ask your father.

Bearing in mind that the role of Leo is soon to be re-cast, it is interesting that, while encouraging him to take up weight-training in episode 1761, Mick has this to say to his son: "By the time you go back to school, you'll be a different fella.".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Jules lies down on her hotel room bed and starts to cry, wondering why Nat has not come back to her on their wedding night, after he has just gone downstairs to retrieve his wallet. She doesn't realise that he has gone to spent the night in another room nearby with his sister, and lover - Georgia.

Footnote:

I intended to include the following as a "goof" for this season:

Although Jacqui's navel was pierced in episode 1634, it was never then seen on-screen at the same time as her face, suggesting that a stand-in may have appeared as her stomach just for that scene. And, throughout episode 1754, when she is frequently seen wearing an outfit revealing that area again, her navel no longer appears to be pierced!

However, despite closely inspecting the many relevant scenes again (purely in the interests of accuracy, of course.......) I'm still not absolutely convinced!! Anyone?
