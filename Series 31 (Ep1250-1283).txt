The first scene of episode 1250 begins with an image similar to, and replacing, the final one that normally appears in the opening titles sequence, with Frank's Cortina parked in the distance on the right, and the "Brookside Close" sign in the foreground on the left. A postman is then seen walking past the sign, and on into the Close to deliver the mail!

The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard, and the creatures are seen, again in episode 1269, when Matthew watches them.

In episode 1275, Max is taken ill - in a somewhat "Basil Fawlty" kind of way - and the final scene is of the ambulance taking him away. The view of the Close after the ambulance has gone remains throughout the closing credits, instead of the usual one.

The storylines:

Anna drifts into prostitution, after being introduced to escort work by Barry's partner Joe - who, after she swindles him and unsuccessfully tries to frame him for the attempted murder of Jimmy, is persuaded to disappear by strange newcomer Oscar. It looks as if it may be the end of the marriages of both the Farnhams and the Dixons, as Patricia files for divorce when Max sleeps with Susannah, and Bev, now pregnant (but possibly by Mike), moves in with Ron while DD goes into a convent. And it's definitely the end for Trevor, who is killed by Mandy and Beth, and buried under a patio laid by Sinbad. But although they manage to avoid this becoming known by Rachel, their neighbours, the Shackletons or the police, will they be able to keep it a secret from Trevor's sister Brenna?


The dates:

Based on dialogue in episode 1254, it is Wednesday in episode 1255, when it is also Christian Aid Week.

Births:

None.

It is the unseen Mrs Babs Dean's birthday soon in episode 1265, when Oscar buys Barry's Spanish villa for her. We are reminded in episodes 1276 and 1278 that Bev had an abortion at the age of 14, and are told in the latter episode that the bloke who got her pregnant on that occasion was working on the school extension.

Deaths:

In perhaps one of the most unexpected shock revelations of the whole series, Mandy and Beth discover in episode 1250 that Trevor is still alive, despite their attempts to poison him. But by the end of that episode he is dead, after Mandy stabs him with a kitchen knife. Detective Inspector Kent reveals that the man convicted of killing Sue and Danny [ie Graeme] was murdered in prison (1259); and unseen and never-to-be-seen characters who are no longer alive that are also mentioned are: Julia's husband, Arthur (1274); Oscar's parents (1279); Lyn and Bev's father (1281); and both of DD's parents, who died within weeks of each other (1283).

Mentioned, so far unseen, but sure to turn up at some point:

Lyn's ex-husband, Steve (1281).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

The Shackletons, including Mr Shackleton (1250, 1259, 1260, 1261); Derek / Degsy (1253, 1255, 1256 / 1252); Diana (1255, 1273, 1280); Sinbad's mother (1255, 1268); Leanne (1256, 1268, 1270); Fran Pearson (1260, 1261, 1262); Steven (1260, 1261, 1262); Sue Sullivan (1261, 1262); Danny (1262); Lyn and Bev's mother (1266, 1278, 1281); Sammy (1267); The Harrisons / Peter's father (1268 / 1253); Dolly Sparrow (1272, 1274); "Renee" [Doreen] (1272); and Gemma (1277).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Helen, Rachel's friend (1251); Sinbad's father (1255); Janice, who works with Jacqui (1256); Lindy Laa / Linda Smith, disc jockey (1256, 1257, 1258 / 1257); Jeff's wife and grown-up kids (1257); Joan, Alan's wife (1260); Carol, a possibly non-existent barmaid known to Anna (1264); Mrs Babs Dean, Oscar's wife (1264, 1265, 1266, 1277, 1279, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1283) and her sister (1279); Mrs Reid, who requires a floral tribute (1266); Anna's mother (1270); Agnes Finnigan, who worked with David (1272); Anastacia in Archangel, one of his radio contacts (1272, 1274); Tommy, at a garage Barry uses (1276); Steve Allen, Barry's brief (1277); Neil, a gay guy who may be willing to marry Anna (1278); and the Bickerstaffs, dancing rivals of Julia (1282).

Goofs:

In episode 1256 Andrew says "I'll throw myself out", when surely he means "show".

It is made clear many, many times later in episode 1257 that the Crosbies' party is to take place on Wednesday - so David's first mention of it is slightly inaccurate: "In fact, we're planning to lower the tone of the neighbourhood, by having a wild party on Friday".

Joe has an even more strange conception of time, when stressing the urgency of a task she delegates in episode 1266: "And now, not yesterday".

When Julia has previously mentioned her late husband by name (in episodes 304, 438 and 947) he has been "Albert". But in episode 1274, and on many subsequent occasions over the next five years, he becomes "Arthur".

Lyn adds an extra "in" in episode 1281: "He's moving in a load more of her stuff in".
