Colin Meredith becomes the first actor to play a fourth different credited role - a record that not many others will ever match! - as court official Bernard, by far the most memorable of all his characters.

The four speaking jury members in the Jordache trial appear in all six of its episodes, but only have dialogue in the last one. Nice work if you can get it.......and the performers chosen for these roles are possibly being rewarded for their past good service, unless it is only a remarkable coincidence that they have ALL made previous appearances as other "Brookside" characters!

The storylines:

The mystery plague claims Audrey, rather than Jean, as a third victim; but when they are given the all-clear, the residents return to celebrate the anniversary of V.E. Day, and find that there is now an outbreak of pregnancy on the Close, affecting both Rosie and Mandy. When Mandy and Beth appear in court, however, they are both sent to prison for the murder of Trevor, and most - but not all - of the residents begin to campaign for their release. Meanwhile, both Katie and Jacqui are attracted to the same man - Mike's boss Shaun - while Leo's teacher Jenny is more than attracted to Mick, convincing herself and most of Mick's neighbours that he has asked her to marry him! In Barry's absence, Carl's efforts to run the club lead to conflict with Max, and major difficulties involving importers of illegal beer, the Donnellys. But will enlisting Jimmy's help to deal with them resolve the problems, or just make them a whole lot worse?

The dates:

It is the 29th in episode 1548; the Grand National is tomorrow in episode 1552; and, based on a poster seen in episode 1554, it is Good Friday in episode 1555. Based on dialogue in episode 1557, it is Friday in episode 1558; it is 50 years since the end of World War Two in episode 1559, and Tuesday, based on dialogue in episode 1558, when the anniversary of V.E. Day is coming up soon. Its 50th anniversary is "a week today" in episode 1560 / "next week" in episode 1561; the celebration takes place in episode 1563, and it was "yesterday" in episode 1564. Posters seen in episode 1561 state that the car boot sale, seen taking place in episode 1562, is on 2nd May. In episodes 1562 and 1563, the trial is to begin "next Monday"; and in episode 1564 it begins "on Monday" - so it is Monday in episode 1565, when it begins! It is 1995 in episode 1567, based on references to past events in that episode; it is Thursday in episode 1572; and, based on dialogue in episode 1574, it is Tuesday in episode 1576. It is the 1990s in episode 1578; and, based on the calendar in Lesley Donnelly's office, it is June in episode 1579.

Cracker, into Jimmy's specimen bottle (1545); Bev (1547); Jackie (1548 and 1580); Jean (1551 and 1580); Lee (1551); Rachel (1554 and 1556); Mike (1556); Jacqui, allegedly (1559); Sinbad (1560); Beth (1565); Mandy (1565 and 1573); Carl (1574); Mick (1575); Leo (1577); and Shaun (1578). Sinbad is also "bursting" in episode 1545, in which all the residents are asked to give specimens; Ron is desperate for the toilet in episode 1547; and Jenny says she had to go to the loo in "La Luz" in episode 1574, but flaws in the rest of her story cast serious doubt even on this claim.......

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Keith Fear, the Farnhams' bank manager (1573); and Jenny's father (1574).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Barry Grant / "Bazza" (1545, 1547, 1548, 1549, 1550, 1551, 1552, 1553, 1554, 1555, 1556, 1557, 1560, 1561, 1562, 1563, 1571, 1572, 1573, 1574, 1576, 1579, 1580, 1581 / 1578); Garry Salter (1545, 1550, 1553, 1554, 1555, 1556, 1557, 1559, 1560, 1571, 1572, 1578, 1580); Mrs Audrey Manners / Snodgrass (1545, 1548, 1549, 1550, 1551, 1552, 1554, 1560, 1573 / 1573); Fran (1547, 1549); Trevor Jordache (1547, 1548, 1562, 1564, 1565, 1566, 1567, 1568, 1569, 1570, 1571, 1578, 1580) / That Jordache Man (1557); Dr Houghton (1548); Renee / Doreen (1549 / 1562); Emma's father (1549); Mr George Manners (1550, 1551, 1553, 1554); Susannah (1550, 1552); DD (1552, 1575); Rebecca / Becca (1552 / 1562); Garry's mother (1556); Tony (1558, 1559); Cyril Dixon, Ron's father (1563 / 1558, 1559, 1560, 1561, 1564); Sinbad's mother (1561); Kathy, and her lad who did a runner from the Army (1562); Billy (1562, 1571); Lyn (1565); Kenny Maguire (1570, 1573); Leo's Aunty Lou (1572); Simon (1573); Marianne (1577, 1578); and Penny (1578, 1579).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Alan, a tall fella with glasses, who Jimmy sends Carl to meet at the end of Royal Street (1547); Johnny Simpson, an Australian who wanted Jean (1548); Richard Sims, a cult member (1548); Ted, David's friend in Hove, and Marjorie, his wife (1551); Gilbert in Cambridge, another friend of David (1552); Cheryl, barmaid at "La Luz" (1552); Jane, from Jean's past (1552); Nigel Beattie, a pencil-necked creep who gets the job of assistant manager of the leisure centre instead of Jacqui (1556); Smith, on trial in court number 5 (1565); the wife and "several" children of juror Brian Halliwell (1570); Shaun's father (1571, 1578); Christine from the leisure centre (1572); Tony Sykes, a client of Shaun (1572); Alan, brewery rep on the phone to Max (1574); someone's "little brother Henry", subject of a television dedication (1577); Clifford Graham, the usual presenter of "Loud And Clear" (1579, 1580), and the wife from whom he has split (1579).

Goofs:

According to Mandy towards the end of episode 1548, the newspaper article about Ron's shop is by "that Roache again" - but when seen earlier in that episode, read by Ron, the feature "Killer Bug Link With Local Shop" is written by "John Lindsey".

Jimmy uses the wrong acronym in episode 1550: "Get yourself over to Barry's house R S V P, all right?", and omits the word "getting" in episode 1580: "Me and Carl here'll get cracking on the furniture back.".

Trivia:

The Jordache trial takes place in court number 3 (1565, 1569, 1570). On its first day, the case of the Crown v Smith is taking place in court number 5 (1565), and hate-mail reading "I'LL BE IN COURT WATCHING YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON. ROT IN HELL!" arrives. The date of the alleged murder of Trevor was on or about 7th May 1993 (1565), and 12th May 1993 was five days after his death (1566). Rachel was 14 when he came to the Close (1566); it was May when he was found in bed with her (1569); and Beth was 7 years old when she first saw him hit Mandy, after a birthday party (1567). Mandy, who is right-handed (1564), pressed charges against Trevor in 1990 (1567, 1569), after he put her in hospital on 5th September 1990 (1568). Beth, whose christening was at St Agnes' church (1564), is sent to prison for five years (1570, 1571), and Mandy is given concurrent sentences of life and seven years (1570), of which she will serve a minimum of twelve years (1572). Eleanor, one of the jurors seen in jury room 1-3, is a smoker (1570). John Maddox reports on the verdict for "North West News" (1570), and the headline of the newspaper article about the case is "Court Jails 'Evil' Women" (1571).

David borrows from Lee a book "Work Out Computer Studies" in order to help Rachel revise (1574). He originally met Jean, who used to look like Deborah Carr, and liked the singer Johnnie Ray, at a New Year's Eve party in Bristol (1548). David (1579) and Jean (1580) both claim to watch "Question Time"; they visited a distillery in Inverness in 1993 (1546), and they play scrabble with Rachel, who scores 36 points with "zit", after David checks that it really is in the dictionary (1554). Patricia used to like the Bay City Rollers, David Essex and David Cassidy (1555); she did step-aerobics during both of her pregnancies (1557), and, like Max (1553), she is right-handed (1571). Mandy is the 232nd, and Sinbad the 233rd, customer of the "Gift Box" (1555); but, on a less successful day, the takings have only been £3.89 in seven hours (1557). In contrast, the takings on the previous night at "La Luz" have been £2,241.74 (1572).

Julia was in the audience of "The Golden Shot" once (1579), and was the first woman to wear slacks in the bobbin works where she used to be employed (1579). She claims that she was a teenager during the war, [which is only just consistent with the revelation of her age in episode 314, which would mean that she was born in 1920 or 1921!] and once courted a G.I. (1563). Jimmy is left-handed (1572), Mike is left-handed (1575), and Jacqui is right-handed (1557, 1560, 1578). The car in which she passes her driving test at her first attempt is marked "Manor Park School of Motoring", and shows the telephone number 269 3404 (1571). She and Katie, who reads "Marie-Claire" (1573), still have an "Oasis" poster on the back of the door of her flat (1560, 1573, 1575). Tony was 10 when he first had a computer (1558).

Garry's funeral is at St Teresa's (1551). Mick tells Leo, who learned to swim when he was 4 (1572), that he used to be scared of the dark when he was Leo's current age (1559). Mick (1551, 1573), Leo (1577) and Jenny (1571) are all right-handed, and go together to the swimming pool at the Everton Park Sports Centre (1572). Last year Jenny, who runs a photography club at school (1575), was the form teacher of Lee (1571), who was not an easy pregnancy for Rosie (1553). Rosie's darts team has a match at the "Leaden Paul" (?) pub in Doreen Street, near a biscuit factory (1574, 1576). Eddie does the "Guardian" crossword (1553). Carl obtains "Weissbrau" beer (1562, 1575) from the Donnellys, of "Donnelly's Transport Ltd, Vehicle Rental and Contact Hire", whose telephone number is 04925 119542 (1576, 1581), and whose safe is from "Withy Grove Stores" (1579). We see again the pizza parlour's telephone number, 051 269 2434 (1564, 1578) and the florists' number, 269 3626 (1556 partly, 1571, 1578), on Mick's van; and another taxi from Manor Car Line, bearing the number 269 6699, is seen in episode 1572.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Posters of Mandy and Beth are seen at various points from episode 1575 onwards, but are never on-screen long enough to be fully read. Their full text is as follows:

Mandy and Beth Jordache Are Innocent! Victims of domestic violence should be helped, not punished. We need your support to change the law. Write to your local M.P. now and free the Jordache women. Sign our petition.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Jimmy continues his impression of Barry Grant by setting fire to various vehicles in the Donnellys' yard, as the sirens of a fire engine arriving can be heard. He and Carl climb onto a roof, and a fireman follows Carl, but trips. Carl pulls the fireman to safety, as Jimmy returns to where he has left Cracker, and picks her up. He looks around the yard, as it continues to blaze - but where is Carl?
