John Basham previously played another role - the Gazette Rep in episode 296. Also returning are the Magic Rabbits, watched on television by Claire in episode 417.

The storylines:

Doreen goes on spending, Billy loses another job, Sandra leaves the Close, Pat and Terry go to Barbados, a deaf tenant comes and goes, and Harry gains and loses a grandchild. But this short season is something of a showcase for original cast member Amanda Burton, now about to leave the series. Heather appears in almost all of the episodes, and is the focus of many of the cliffhangers, as she battles to discover her husband's secret, then does all she can to save him and her marriage. Ultimately, however, she has to admit defeat and move on.......

The dates:

It is a year since Tom Curzon proposed to Heather in episode 414, it is Monday in episode 415, and November in episode 419, in which we are told that Pat and Terry are to fly out to Barbados on November 10th and return on November 24th. This reveals the dates on which Barbados scenes occur in episode 422, when it is "three days" until they fly home, and in episode 423, when the plane flies "tomorrow". In episode 427, there are 25 more shoplifting days until Christmas.

Name-checks:

Jean Shrimpton, model (403); "Typhoid Mary" (406); Dr Kildare (410); Lewis Carroll (411); Little Bo Peep (411); Joan Collins (413); Crystal [Carrington?] (413); Dalglish, footballer (414); Rachman (418 ); Lord Derby (420); Guy Fawkes (420); "The Archers" (421); the Lone Ranger and Tonto (421); the Queen (422); David Bailey (423); Margaret Rutherford (423); Wild Bill Hickock (423); the ArchDuke Ferdinand (423); Winston Churchill (424); Bob Geldof (427); and Peter Pan (428 ).

Locations:

While most of the action is set in Liverpool, there are several scenes in Delamere in episode 404 and in Chester in episode 419; and a considerable amount of action takes place in Barbados throughout episodes 421 to 424.

Births:

None. Sally's baby, the unseen Harriet, due in the first week of January (407), is born prematurely in episode 427. Cecile is 32 (401); Karen is 20 (405); Damon was born on 29th February, so he is now four-and-a-half (409); Gail is Aries (409); Ruth is 16 (409); Gill is 30 (412); Tracy is 16 (429); and Nick is 45 (429). According to Bobby, Guy is 20 (408 ). Edna's gravestone indicates that she was born on 4th March 1920 (408 ). In episode 421, Paul mentions that it was his birthday - which Lucy forgot - last week.

Marriages:

None. Heather and Nick have been married for two months in episode 404 and three months in episode 411.

Deaths:

One - Nicholas Black dies of a heroin overdose / hypothermia. His body is identified in episode 430, after a policeman reveals that it has been found in episode 429. Edna's gravestone indicates that she died on 3rd September 1985 (408 );. Tommy mentions that his father is dead (418 ), and his elder brother was killed in a plane crash when he was in the RAF (421). Gail explains that her grandmother, famous palm reader Madam Zola, was killed in a plane crash when she was little (420) - and Damon, of course, queries why she didn't predict that it was going to crash. Avril mentions that her mother is dead (424), and newly born baby Harriet dies in episode 428.


Toilet visits:

Damon says he needs to go in episode 409, but he may just be trying to avoid going to bed with Gail, and he changes his mind anyway when he finds a man in the bath. Gail goes on to create a speed record which is going to be hard to beat in episode 413 - after assuring Damon, "Won't be a sec - just going for a pee, love", the elapsed time between her first step onto the stairs to the Grants' toilet upstairs, and hitting the same step on her way back down, is a mere 35 seconds. "Mrs McArdle" also pays a call, while on the plane home from Barbados (425).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Adam (401); Lucy Collins (401, 403, 410, 416, 421, 422, 430); Cathy (401); Tom Curzon (401, 404, 414, 420, 428 ); Chris's mother (402); Michelle (403); Fleming (403); Henty (404, 420, 430); Roger (404); Cribbs-Baker (405); Jessica (406, 408, 427); Edna Cross (407, 408, 412, 418, 427, 429); Pam (407); Grace (408 ); Kate (409); Teresa (410, 414, 418, 424); Ginnie (411); George Williams (414); Alun (414); Jane (414, 420, 425, 430); Lindsay (415, 416); Arthur Dutton (417, 421, 424); Michael Tomlinson [Tommo] (417); Drucker (419); Joyce (429); and Eileen (430).

Not seen yet, but hopefully worth waiting for: Doreen's boss, Mr Howman, is mentioned yet again in episode 420.

And those that are also mentioned, but are sadly destined to remain unseen forever (in order of non-appearance):

Gail's grandad (405); Sally's mother (408 ); Doreen's aunt, who went into a mental hospital (407); Archie, drug supplier (409); Gareth, one of Gail's brothers (412); Damon's aunty Irene (413); Sue, Heather's secretary (413); Gail's father and mother (413) and "loads" of brothers and sisters (414); Rob's father (413); Pat's mother (418 ); Mike, who sells Gordon a motorbike (421); Pierre (421, 429); Jeff in Planning, who Nick claims loaned him money (422); Sammy, Barry's friend (425); Jack Nelson's sister (425); Joey Kavanagh, for whom Billy did a job (426); John and Wendy Hughes, for whom Annabelle has agreed to cook on New Year's Eve (429); and Gina, Tracy's friend (430).

Goofs:

Bobby says the opposite of what he means in episode 415: "....talk me out of not going to the members...."

Harry seems to regard the wrong person as his offspring in episode 416: "It's gonna be for Kevin and my Sally".

Nick (417) and Heather (418 ) both carefully cover with their thumbs the names appearing on the cashpoint cards seen in close-up shots on-screen...... but unfortunately it is a Midland Bank card that is received in episode 417 by Nick, after he has requested a replacement for the National Girobank card which is cut up in episode 416, and seen again in episode 418! It is Heather who banks with the Midland - her cheque book is seen in episode 422.
