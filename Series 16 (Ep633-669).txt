The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard again, although the creatures are not seen, as the programme is watched by Growler in episode 662.

Among the guest performers in this season are Liz Gebhardt, who was one of the pupils in "Please Sir"; Jamila Massey, who was one of the students in "Mind Your Language"; and Joanna Foster, who was one of many Wendy Barlows in "Coronation Street"!

The storylines:

After Paul confronts Annabelle over her affair with Brian, they try to patch up their marriage; Chrissy unsuccessfully tries to educate Growler at home; and Sheila and Billy become closer, albeit without Barry's blessing. Tracy is unfairly dismissed, but able to prove it; while Gordon is fairly dismissed after selling cars for a fraction of their true value. While Jonathan prepares to set himself up in business with Sarah, Frank has more troubles at work, Ralph gets a new dog, Sammy gets a new admirer, and Katie gets a new face. And there are a lot of weddings being planned - Harry's hopes of marrying Betty come to nothing, but Kirsty and Rod, Mona and Gerald, and Terry and Sue are all still in with a chance of tying the knot, even though Rod is seeing someone else, Mona may not be of sound mind, and Sue is pregnant by another man.......

The dates:

In episode 633 it is a year since Damon died, a year since Sue and Terry met, and, based on dialogue from episode 632, it is Monday. In episode 635 it is 12 months since the Rogers family arrived, and in episode 637 Tommo has been in hospital for 12 weeks. In episode 638 it is the middle of winter, and in episode 640 it is 1988, based on Bumper's observation that Growler is 90 years too late in dating a poster "1898". It is Christmas Day / Sunday in episodes 644 and 645; and New Year's Eve, then New Year's Day, in episode 647. It is 1989 in episodes 649 and 664, and 18th January 1989 in episode 653. In episode 651, the date set for Rod and Kirsty's wedding is Saturday 15th July, and this is mentioned again in episode 667. In episode 659 it is Ash Wednesday and, later in that episode, it must be 9th February, based on an earlier reference to Ronnie's birthday. It is Valentine's Day in episode 660, and it will soon be Mothers' Day in episode 665. In episode 650 the date of Tracy's tribunal is set for March 6th at 10.30; in episode 664, it is "next week"; but in episode 666 it is rescheduled for March 15th, which is "a week on Wednesday". When it finally takes place, in episode 669, the late arrival at work of Tracy and Nikki, seen in episode 642. is said to have occurred on 24th December.

Name-checks:

Locations:

All of the action in this season takes place in Liverpool, with the exception of just four scenes in episode 653 which are set in Margaret's home in Basingstoke, which Sheila and Claire are briefly visiting. It seems unlikely, however, that these scenes were actually recorded in Basingstoke.

Births:

One - Tim Haynes, son of Kevin Cross and Sally Haynes, is born in episode 642, and is "a couple of weeks old" in episode 660. Ronnie celebrates her birthday, which is 9th February / soon (655) and "next week" (657), in episode 659. We are also told that Paul is 13 years older than Annabelle (633), and that Claire is nearly 4 (636), Rod is 20 going on 49 (637), Debbie is 18 (647), Tracy is 18 (643, 651), Growler is 14 (651, 661), Mona is 80 (663) and Barry is 29 (655).

Deaths:

Two - Harry and Ralph's dog Rommel dies in episode 642 after chewing poisonous cuddly seals, and "Worzel" the tramp is found dead by Rod Corkhill in episode 654.

Although Sammy claims she has to go in episode 660, this is just an excuse to retrieve a bottle-opener.

Goofs:

Interrogated by the Superintendent, Rod refers to Tommo as PC "Thomson", rather than Tomlinson, for a second time in episode 639.

In the same episode, Julia gets something slightly wrong when talking about Billy: "She's married to my daughter.".

In episode 642, Barry pronounces Danny Wood's surname as if the second "o" is a "d".

The first time Mr Thomas pronounces Gerrard's surname in episode 651, he says "Holst" instead of "Holt".

While Nisha's parents interview Sammy in episode 657, the name a cashier is heard calling from downstairs, and to which her father responds, does not sound anything like "Mr Batra". In the same episode, her mother's observation that "There's seven of us" would suggest that Nisha is one of five siblings, and since she has both "brothers" and "sisters", there must be two of each. This, unfortunately, contradicts her earlier claim that she shares a bedroom with "three of" her sisters.

She's not the first, but in episode 659, Annabelle gets two words the wrong way around: "Empire and Commonwealth Club".

While referring to the firm she works for, a partnership, Sarah describes it as "this company" in episode 664.

The chart that Gordon draws, installs on his ceiling and periodically updates, seems to be different almost every time we see it. Initially, at the end of episode 652, it shows about 12 days at the end of January and the whole of March, but only about 20 days in February. In episode 653, there are only 6 days at the end of January, and he marks an "X" at the fifth last. In episode 656, there are 13 days shown at the end of January, and he marks an "X" at the last of these.
