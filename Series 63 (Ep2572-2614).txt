While Anthea packs her bags and leaves the Close forever, the prosecution, defence and judge sum up the case of the Crown versus Ron Dixon, and the jury reaches verdicts which are bound to provoke diverse reactions. Will Ron be jailed?

Although, for scheduling reasons, six episodes (2600/2601, 2606/2607 and 2612/2613) were originally broadcast in three 60-minute Wednesday timeslots, all were shown in their entirety, with complete opening and closing credits, instead of being edited into artificial double-length omnibus editions as had occurred many times previously.

There is a short sequence in episode 2577 in which the journey of Lindsey, Jimmy and Tim along a pavement in pursuit of Robbie is shown as a series of fades - and, later in that episode, there is a rapid camera pan from Shirley Moffat to WPC Williams, at a completely different location, holding a shoe in a bag.

Episode 2581 is the first since episode 750 whose part one does not end with one of the standard "End of Part One" caption slides of the Close. Instead, these words are superimposed over the last images of the action in that instalment - Max and Jacqui kissing on the ferry on which they have just been married.

The appearances of Clint Moffat in episode 2587 are only in very brief flashbacks of three scenes with Katie Rogers from earlier episodes.

In episode 2614, we see Anthea at home, packing, preparing to leave, and leaving, while we hear various officials speaking in the courtroom.

The performers portraying the clerk of the court and both of the barristers in the trial of Ron Dixon would all appear in similar roles, sometimes in the same episodes, in the 2004 Mersey Television daytime drama series "The Courtroom" !

The storylines:

There are money troubles all around the Close, as Diane and Marty are forced to abandon their IVF treatment after achieving more strife than pregnancy, Steve can't find another job, Rachel and Mike's loan becomes fully repayable on demand after they default on the instalments, and Tim plans a return to crime in the hope of improving his and Emily's lifestyle. Meanwhile, Ray curbs the temptation facing Jessie in young doctor Neil, and Christy drives a wedge between Lance and Leanne - but Nikki gives Jerome another chance, and Jacqui marries Max. Imelda and Paige return to bully Anthony again, Jimmy and Jackie are divorced, and Lindsey also leaves Jimmy when she gets a new job in Newcastle. But Rod makes a brief return, and Nisha also persuades Sammy to come back to support Katie, who is still not handling the loss of Clint at all well in the weeks leading up the trial of Ron for his murder. Robbie isn't exactly helping, determined to make the Dixons' lives as difficult as possible - even if he has to confess to burglary in court to clear Clint's name and discredit Ron's evidence. And Anthea's failure to convincingly lie under oath spells the end of her marriage - but is Ron going to lose his freedom forever?

It is Hallowe'en in episode 2601; it is Bonfire Night [or 3rd November - see "Goofs" below] in episode 2603; and Christmas is in "a few weeks' time" in episode 2605. Based on dialogue in episode 2606, in which it is November, and episode 2607, it is Friday in episode 2608; and, based on dialogue in episode 2608, it was Wednesday in episode 2606 and Thursday in episode 2607. It is Monday, then Tuesday in episode 2611; and it is still Tuesday in episode 2612. In episode 2573, Marty tells Adele that it will take her until the year 2010 to pay for contact lenses; and, in episode 2601, Jimmy recalls that Trevor Jordache was killed and buried under the patio in 1993.

Jackie and Jimmy have been married "nearly 30 years" according to Anthea (2583) / "30 years" (2601) / "29 years" (2604); their decree nisi indicates that they were married on 2nd December 1971 at St Christopher's Church, Manor Park, Liverpool (2589); and the decree absolute brings their marriage to an end in episode 2606. We are also reminded that Diane and Marty have been married for seven years (2596); and we are told that Billy and Sheila [Corkhill] are "still together, still happy" (2599).

Deaths:

None. We are reminded that Susannah died "a few months ago" (2572) / "on Bonfire Night" (2580) / "a year ago to the day" (2603) [see "Goofs" below], and her gravestone indicates that she died in 2000 (2581, 2582); it is two years ago tomorrow / today that Emily's father and brother died (2572 / 2573); Clint was 23 when he died (2573, 2585); and Ron's father died on a New Year's Eve (2605).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Mr Jones, a teacher (2573); Billy, a member of the bar staff (2573); Jessica Dealy, a classmate of Adele who has contact lenses (2573); Mr Lloyd, Lisa's solicitor (2576); Michelle's mother (2584); Mrs Carter, Katie and Nisha's supervisor (2585); Mr Donnelly of Donnelly's Garage, to whom Steve has applied for a job (2590); Chantale, assistant at the shop "Ganders" at which Jessie has shopped (2590); Dr Romani at the fertility clinic, who Diane telephones (2591); Robert, a friend of Anthony, and his mother (2593); Imelda's sister (2595); Father O'Brien, who walked in on Diane the first time she was having sex (2596); Mr Frazer, [Rodney Bennett] headmaster (2598); Bullseye, Leanne and Lance's dog when they were younger (2598); Dexter, who lives next-door-but-one to Brigid (2598); Stephanie, a friend of Kylie (2601); Shireen, a mate of Becky (2602); Sheila, in the Health Club office (2603); Sol's sister-in-law (2604); Neil's mother (2604); Eve, Sol's daughter (2604); Hazel from the "Old Swan" salon (2605); Rose McGuinness, an old flame of Ray's (2605); Tixie and Addock from Runcorn, Ray's wartime mates (2605); Lorraine Nelson, a bully who tried to make Nisha sing "Onward Christian Soldiers" (2606); Paul O'Brien, Anthony's year head (2608); one of Imelda Clough's parents (2608); and Mrs Carroll, Kylie's teacher (2613).

Goofs:

In episode 2573, Brigid's fifth word should probably have been in the possessive rather than the second: "Your appointment's with the specialist tomorrow, isn't it?"; and in episode 2574, Max's third word, "to", goes missing: "Just seeing a bit of business, you know.".

It is erroneously implied by Max in episode 2580 that Susannah died on Bonfire Night, rather than 3rd November. Not only is he still of this opinion, but Jacqui is also similarly convinced, in episode 2603.

Eight episodes after Adele celebrates her sixteenth birthday in episode 2575, the following dialogue from episode 2583 is a rare example of sheer carelessness:

Quote:

LANCE: I know for a fact you're only 15.
ADELE: Yeah, but I look older.


As an official document, Jimmy's decree absolute, seen in episode 2606, should surely mention the full and proper names of the parties involved - and, although the ex-wife is "Mrs Jacqueline Corkhill", the ex-husband is "Mr Jimmy Corkhill".

Ron is knocking a few years off for no apparent reason in episode 2612 - "I'm 50 years of age." - and Anthea's declaration in episode 2613 that she has known Ron for 20 years, but didn't see him for 17 of them, contradicts dialogue in episodes 2114 and 2551 regarding when they met (when they were about 9 / nearly 31 years ago). As time has moved on, it seems that she has known him for progressively less and less of it.......

In episode 2613, both the loan man and Mike refer to the loan company inconsistently with the name on the letter that was seen in episode 2591 - "North Mersey Securities Ltd". According to the loan man, he is from "North Merseyside Securities", and, according to Mike, it's "North West Securities". But in episode 2614, Mike calls the company "North Merseyside Securities" as well!

Trivia:

Kylie has a cuddly toy tiger called "Mr Stripes", which she leaves with Jimmy (2613); and Beth has a "Special Saver Account" - number 367848920009 with the Merseyside and Widnes Building Society, which has a balance of £300.00 in episode 2595, but a balance of zero in episode 2600, because Rachel has withdrawn £312.55, including £12.55 interest earned since the original deposit, to repay an instalment of their loan, which totals at £5,230 by episode 2613. In episode 2591 she receives a final demand dated Monday 8th October 2001 from the lender - North Mersey Securities Ltd, Longhume House, 100-102 Fleetham Street Liverpool L1 1LM, whose telephone number is 0151 496 4960, whose fax number is the [strangely familiar.......] 0151 692 6149, and whose reference number is 86902 DIXM; and in episode 2576, Ron also receives a letter, dated September 2001, from his solicitor, David Mowrem, whose telephone number appears to be 0151 228 0168. It advises him to attend his pre-trial hearing at Liverpool Crown Court on 2nd October 2001 at 11.30 am. Both letters are correctly addressed to 8 Brookside Close, Manor Park, Liverpool L43 6TZ. Although he has previously quoted a higher figure, Ron is now of the fairly accurate view that he has lived next door to Max for ten years (2573). His mobile phone displays the number of "Jacq" as 07960381286 (2612), his trial takes place in Court 3 (2613, 2614), and the headline of a newspaper report about it reads "Manor Park Gun Trial Begins" (2609).

Jimmy reveals that Sheila and Billy are still together, and still happy (2599); and Rod reveals that Sheila now has two flower shops, and Billy now weighs 18 stone and is as grey as a badger (2607). Jimmy's pills bottle indicates that he got them from MANOR PARK PHARMACY, MANOR PARK AVENUE, MANOR PARK, LIVERPOOL (2590). The maxims on his computer screen are LESSON 3: BEWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES NB FORGET THE CONSEQUENCES LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (2590); RULE FOUR: LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES! (2592); and YEAR ZERO, DAY 2. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE (2608); he is seen consulting a book entitled "Indispensable Internet" (2594); and he sends an electronic greetings card "To Jacqui and Max - Congratulations on your very special day. Love, Jimmy." (2576). The newlyweds honeymoon in Barbados (2583, 2600) - and Rachel and Mike remind them thay they had their honeymoon there too, although that one was also meant to be Jacqui's! (2600). The schools Lisa wants Max to consider for Harry and Emma, costing £1,000 a term, include Wenton Hall Primary School (2575). Jacqui, whose health club is called "Brookside Place Health Club" (2603), reminds him that Lindsey once stole £11,000 from her (2601); and, after she promises to pay him, but fails to, Max pays Ray £257.76 for 144 tiles he obtained for Susannah's kitchen (2605, 2607). Ray, who has a hiatus hernia (2583) and did his national service in Malaya (2605, 2610), takes Ron, Anthea and Jessie - who is seen looking at Neil's October 2001 issue of "BLAST" magazine (2588) - to the Elmwood Bowling Club (2587). Neil is seen reading an article entitled "Hand Analysis and Sexuality" (2590), and discusses it with Nikki, who reveals that her old mate Bernie has dropped out of her course at university, with £3,000 of debt (2605).

Adele gets three A's and five 5's in her GCSEs (2572); Jan left Marty ten years ago (2597); Diane won a talent contest in Llandudno in 1995 against a six-year-old from Wigan and a half-dead septagenarian (2595); the junior school which Anthony, Imelda and Paige went to was "Blessed Rodney Bennett" (2593, 2608); and Christy, who is seen reading - well, looking at - a magazine called "PHWOAR!" (2590) - was in Borstal for six months as a kid (2597). In episode 2576, an e-mail he discovers Leanne has written to Bev reads as follows:

Bev, things are getting worse. The police want to make an example of you and you've been on the front page of the Echo as a wanted woman and the telly's been here filming the bar. Don't worry, I told them where to go. If I was you I'd stay as far away as poss. Love Leanne xxxx

Leanne sings - if it can be called that - "It's A Heartache" and "Congratulations" (2584). She and Lance had a dog called "Bullseye" when they were young (2598), and he confirms DD's suspicions that [unlike her own children!] he went to Manor Park Comprehensive (2581). Tim claims, dubiously, that he once played the Artful Dodger in a school play (2598). He and Steve visit J. EVANS CAR SALES, leaving it with a somewhat smashed showroom window, in episode 2591.

Newspaper articles with headlines "GUILTY! Body under patio pair sentenced", "POLICE IDENTIFY BODY UNDER PATIO", "BODY UNDER PATIO: POLICE SEEK WOMAN" and "WANTED: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS FAMILY?" are seen on Jimmy's walls in episode 2601. He prints signs reading "DON'T GET CAUGHT" and "IF YOU DO GET CAUGHT, DON'T WHINGE!" in episode 2588, puts them up on Tim's wall in episode 2589, and they are still there in episodes 2592 and 2593. Clint's previous address, to which Katie sent him love letters, was Hostel San Miguel, Calle Roldan, Alicante, Spain (2574). There is a "Fletcher's" for sale sign, similar to those seen previously, on "Trina's Tots" in episodes 2592 and 2594; there are posters of Britney Spears, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton on Emily's bedroom wall in episode 2580; there is a poster of the "Chemical Brothers" on Anthony's bedroom wall in episode 2598, and there are posters of Kate Bush on Adele's bedroom wall in the same episode, in which she listens to music by that artist. Brigid (2573), Jacqui (2575), Nikki (2582, 2586, 2609), Tim (2586), Nisha (2586), Marty (2590), Mr Neville (2593), Ron (2602), Jackie (2606), the judge (2609, 2614), Lindsey (2611), and Anthea (2614) are all right-handed, whereas Mike (2586, 2601), and Diane (2595) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 2587, just after he has delivered his bowl, and having made sure that Ray is not able to see him, Ron shoves the mat a few yards backwards with his foot, so that his opponent needs to bowl a longer distance to reach the jack!

In episode 2594, Christy brings in rain-mates that he plans to sell in the bar - and for just 15 seconds in one of their scenes in the bar later on in that episode, Tim and Steve are each wearing one while they chat over a drink!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Max assures a reluctant Mike that, as Ron wanted, he and Jacqui can look after "Great Grannies" in his absence. He prepares to set off for home with Jacqui, who has just returned from an emotional few minutes visiting Ron in his cell, and assuring him that everybody will help him to get through the nine-month sentence he has just received for illegally obtaining and possessing a firearm. But Katie sees them, and attacks her former friend both verbally and physically, insisting that she will demand a re-trial. Jacqui protests that Ron has been acquitted of the murder and manslaughter of Clint, and Katie will have to learn to let go and move on. But she storms off, declaring that it's not over for her - she is not being cheated of justice......
