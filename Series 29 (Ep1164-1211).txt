Depending on which sitcoms they watched in the 1970s, viewers may well recognise Kenneth MacDonald and Stuart McGugan from the chorus line of "It Ain't Half Hot, Mum", or Paula Wilcox from "Man About The House".

Alexandra Fletcher's character, previously credited as "Jackie Dixon", is listed as "Jacqui Dixon" from episode 1165 onwards. She is seen watching "The Magic Rabbits" on television in episode 1175, when its music is heard again, although the creatures themselves are not visible.

A new opening titles sequence is used from episode 1191 onwards. This is similar to the one which opened only the previous 36 episodes, but features different images of the petrol station and parade, and has a few added skateboarders. It will begin no less than 660 episodes, which is more than any of the four previous sequences or any of the eight others that will follow.

The closing images of the Close are replaced in episode 1193 only with a view of the parade in which a small crowd is gathered, becoming larger as more of the "Brookside" staff, who are listed alphabetically on the credits for this Christmas episode, run in to join those already assembled and waving.

Rod Corkhill has no dialogue in a fleeting appearance in episode 1200, his last for several years.

The storylines:

The major theme explored in this season is date-rape, as an unseen bedroom encounter between Diana and Peter is the subject of much discussion and reflection, leads to a court case, and has a significant effect on the lives of the participants and on their relatives and friends. Meanwhile, Terry is determined to prevent Barry from becoming involved in his life of his son, Patricia's parents return, the nightclub "La Luz" opens, and racist attacks are fought and defeated. The Dixons' marriage looks unsteady, as Ron contemplates having an affair with Jackie Corkhill, while DD opens up her own shop and helps to arrange an abortion for Leanne without telling him. And a few other couples are making plans for futures together - Ellis and Marianne, Sinbad and Marcia, and Derek and Margaret. But is Derek asking Margaret to give up too much to be with him?

The dates:

Based on dialogue in episode 1162, it is Wednesday in episode 1165; and based on dialogue in episodes 1184, 1187 and 1189, it is 21st October 1992. Both Poppy Day and Bonnie Night are "next week" in episode 1167, when it is 1992, and soon in episode 1170. It is Friday night in episodes 1172 and 1175, Saturday morning in episode 1176, and the Queen's 45th wedding anniversary next week in episode 1177. Jimi Hendrix would have been 50 this week in episode 1180, and in episode 1182 it is 92 years to the day since Oscar Wilde said his last words! Based on dialogue in episode 1181, it is Monday in episode 1182; based on dialogue in episode 1182, it is Friday in episode 1187; and in episode 1188 it is a week before Christmas. It is Christmas Eve in episode 1192; it is Christmas Day in episode 1193; it is New Year's Eve, then New Year's Day, in episode 1195; and it is still New Year's Day in episode 1196. Based on dialogue in episode 1197, it is Friday in episode 1199; and, based on dialogue in episode 1202, it is Tuesday in episode 1203 and Wednesday in episode 1204.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool.

Births:

None - Although Fran and Barry's baby son, Steven, is seen for the first time, there are no clear indications of when he was born. We are told that it is a couple of months since Tony's birthday in episode 1169; it is Jackie's birthday in episode 1182, which is "next Monday" in episode 1181; it is Ron's birthday on Christmas Day (1191); and it is Sinbad's birthday soon (1206) / yesterday (1207). Leanne becomes pregnant in Paul's van in episode 1174, she is seven weeks pregnant in episode 1194, and has an abortion in episode 1204. She is 16 next month (1188) / 16 in a few weeks (1194, 1196) / 15 (1197, 1198) / 16 today (1202) / 16 (1203, 1204) / younger than Jacqui (1205). Louise is four and a half months old (1165); Jacqui is 16 (1167); Max is "at least 30" (1167); Marianne's unseen uncle Peter is 73 (1177); Thomas is 3 (1186); Katie is under 16 (1189) / 15 (1191); Margaret is 19 (1204); Claire is 8 (1204); Patricia is in her 30s (1205); Barry is 33 (1208); and Tracy had an abortion nearly three years ago (1208). Lyn's yet-to-be-seen sister Bev also had an abortion, after becoming pregnant at the age of 14 (1194).

Marriages:

None. Rod and Diana have been married for three months in episode 1166; it is Sammy's first wedding anniversary in episode 1174; David and Jean have been married for "30-odd" years (1204); and DD and Ron have been married for 20 years (1209). Marianne and Ellis plan to marry on 14th February (1183), then, as it is a Sunday, as close to it as possible (1198). Sinbad and Marcia then agree to marry on the same day (1199), and the date is set for a couple of days after Valentine's Day, which is in about a month's time (1203) / the week after next (1210).

Deaths:

None. Three unseen characters who are no longer alive are mentioned: DD and Derek's mother (1188); Lyn's father (1194); and Marcia's father (1201).

Toilet visits:

Anna (1165); Gemma (1176 OOV); Jackie (1182); Ellis (1183 and 1210); DD (1185 and 1211); Margaret, Marianne, and Anna (1186); Peter, twice (1199); Tracy (1200); Lyn (1208); and Jimmy (1209). Max also intends to go in episode 1165, but is distracted by Diana and Peter; Sinbad says he was in the gents' at New Year in episode 1196; and Derek runs out of toilet paper in episode 1201. Although Margaret claims that she needs to go to the toilet in episode 1211, this would seem to be only an excuse to leave Derek. Or perhaps she mistakenly thinks that she can't use the one on the aeroplane while it is standing still!

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Marianne's father (1165, 1185, 1186, 1198, 1210); Marianne's brother (1165); Marianne's sister-in-law (1165); Marianne's mother (1165, 1185, 1186, 1198); Marianne's sister (1165, 1185); Jackie's sister [Val] (1169); and Lyn's younger sister, Bev / Beverley (1175, 1193, 1194).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

In episode 1172, Katie wants her hair done like Dawn's in "Meadowcroft Park", who we are told is appearing in a local panto in episode 1195.

Goofs:

In episode 1208, Terry and Fran are seen getting into a taxi whose door displays the telephone number 220 7777, but when they get out of it at the other end of their journey, the number displayed is 480 7777.

With hindsight, and with particular reference to a certain Anthea and a certain illegitimate daughter Megan, it is unfortunate that, when talking about having an affair in episode 1186, Ron says "I've never done anything like this before in my life".

Trivia:

Jimmy and Jackie live at number 100 (1188). Jimmy passed his driving test during the period he recently spent in Birmingham (1182). Jackie went to a Bob Dylan concert on the Isle of Wight when she was younger (1180). Julia implies that she worked in a biscuit factory when she was much younger (1167). The "For Sale" sign at number 10 bearing the name "Binenan Estates" and the telephone number 359 3600 has "Under Offer" (1171, 1177), then "SOLD" (1180, 1181) added.

Terry knew Barry, who is left-handed (1207), when he was five years old (1169). Later, the school Barry went to was St Cuthbert's, at the end of Mount Park Lane (1177). He sends Jimmy to apologise to Karyn at the "Far East" restaurant, at 27 Berry Street, Liverpool, whose telephone numbers are 051 709 3041 and 051 709 6072, according to a business card he has, bearing the name Tony Cheung (1184). When Terry and Fran go to the cinema in episode 1208, the nine films from which they have to choose are "Dracula", "Bodyguard", "Raising Cain", "Chaplin", "Exorcist", "Blade Runner", "Midnight Sting", "A Few Good Men" and "Home Alone 2". Fran says the last film she went to see was "Working Girl".

Ron, who is right-handed (1169), implies that DD, who has an account with the Halifax Building Society (1206), used to live in Byron Street (1206). Among the acts Ron introduces at the Legion are the Jangle Brothers, a country and western act (1175). Having only recently changed the spelling of her name from "Jackie" to Jacqui" (1173), his daughter, who thinks Paul Heaton of "The Beautiful South" is gorgeous (1180), briefly considers changing it again to "Brooke" or "Kelsey" (1175). Leanne is in the same class as Katie at school (1168). Her family - including her father, security guard Ted - live at number 3 (1206).

Patricia, who is right-handed (1205), lived in Stratford when she was 9 or 10 years old (1202). She and Karyn, who regularly shops at Sainsbury's (1176), are seen visiting the premises of PSS, which used to be a Beatles museum (1180). Other clients of theirs include Prime Design (1206), McDonalds' (1208) and Feinstein Williams and Partners (1208). Max wrote a letter to Valerie Singleton when he was ten (1186), and receives a bill for £276.12 (£235 plus VAT) from Frank for the damage to his Cortina (1208). Max's divorce from Susannah was dealt with by Adrian Gilchrist, his solicitor (1205). Thomas has "Coco Pops" for his breakfast (1185). David used to drive an ambulance during his National Service (1200). Derek worked in South America for four months when he was a student (1188).

Peter Andrew Harrison is accused of raping Diana Mary Corkhill (1184). Fifteen years ago he damaged a music centre, then denied touching it (1177). He wears a shirt with the words "Moosehunters, Newbury 1992" (1184). Mick is 6'3" tall (1179) and has no passport (1171). The telephone number of "Pizza Parade", appearing on its van, is 051 269 3434 (1178, 1179). George Webb's local is the "Golden Lion" (1176). Lyn's sister Bev went off the rails when her father died. She became pregnant at the age of 14, and had an abortion without telling anyone, which came to light when she collapsed in school (1194).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Although actress Sue Jenkins was visibly pregnant and about to go on maternity leave at the time of recording her appearances as Jackie in these episodes, carefully-chosen camera angles and/or strategically placed props ensure that this is never apparent. In episode 1183, for example, when Jackie is seen in a medium-length shot in the parade, she is holding a massive box of chocolates which Jimmy has given her as an apology for not keeping in touch while he was in away in Birmingham!

Two other moments from this season are worth highlighting. Firstly, from episode 1168, and the file marked "someone was bound to say it eventually", this exchange occurs on Brookside Parade:

Quote:
SINBAD: Doing a spot of empire building, are you, Ron?

RON: First one shop, then two, then the whole chain, mate. I tell you, there's gonna be a "Dixons" in every high street in England.

SINBAD: There already is!


And secondly, while there are other instances from 21 years of "Brookside" in which all is not quite as it seems, this one from episode 1194 is rather nice:

Quote:
ELLIS: It's up to you, Marianne. Only you can decide.

MARIANNE: I don't know, Ellis. It's a big decision.

ELLIS: Yeah, and you've got to make it. Now do you want to buy a house or not? I need to know now. Tell me. Straight away.

MICK: Don't bully her. She might not like the area.

ELLIS: There's a better area than Mayfair?

[We now see that the trio are seated around a "Monopoly" board]

MARIANNE [handing over money] : Go on, then - I'll have it.


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As they are about to fly off to Romania, Margaret tells Derek that she feels sick and will have to go to the toilet. He realises too late that she is getting off the aeroplane and running down the gangway - a steward prevents him from following her, as the door is closing. In the airport, Ron jokes that he, DD, Patricia and Mrs Clemence are probably all waving to a plane bound for the Isle of Man instead of the one going to Romania. They are all yet to discover that, instead of being on her way to a new life abroad, Margaret has been given a hot drink and is sitting tearfully at a table in a small room elsewhere in the building.
