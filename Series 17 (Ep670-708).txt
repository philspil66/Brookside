Julieanne White is the only "Brookside" performer who had previously appeared in the Australian soap "The Young Doctors", while Nigel Bradshaw is the only performer who had previously had a long-running role, as Officer Dennis Cruickshank, in "Prisoner Cell Block H".

Michelle Byatt is the third, and Sharon Byatt the fourth, member of the same family of performers to appear in "Brookside". Their younger brother and sister have previously been seen, while their older brother, yet to make his debut, would ultimately go on to make more than 800 appearances!

The storylines:

A new family arrives on the Close - Michael, Caroline and Jessica Choi. Soon, it looks as if Michael wants Alison, while Sinbad wants Caroline, and Jessica just wants to play with Katie. Meanwhile, Billy wants Sheila, but Doreen wants Billy. Mona marries Gerald; Terry marries Sue, but Kirsty dumps Rod. Jonathan risks losing Cheryl, Tracy wins a competition, and Harry loses a grave. Chrissy, Paul and Gordon all find new outlets for their talents, but there are setbacks for Growler and Sammy; and someone Annabelle has recently sentenced now wants something more from her.......


The dates:

It is Easter Sunday in episode 672, Spring in episode 673, Wednesday in episodes 677 and 704, Monday in episodes 692 and 703, and Sunday / June / Father's Day in episode 696. The car crash seen in episode 675 was on Saturday (676), and the auction seen in episode 679 takes place on Wednesday (678) / 19th April 1989, starting at 2.00pm (679). In episode 672, Mona recalls meeting Brian Lawrence on Christmas Day - that meeting was seen in episode 643. In episode 682, the war ended 44 years ago. Based on references to Rod's birthday in episode 688, it is Saturday in episode 689. In episode 691, Anthony's wall-calendar shows May 1989. Episode 699 coincides with Wimbledon, which Alison is missing! The trip to Blackpool, seen in episode 689, was six weeks ago in episode 702. It is Summer, and Saturday 5th August, in episode 708, as Sheila is seen setting off on the holiday to Ireland she says is meant to start on that date in episode 704, and Terry and Sue are married, having set the wedding for that date in episode 686.

Locations:

All of the action is set in Liverpool, except that in episode 689 there are several of scenes of Rod, Tommo, Kirsty and Emma in Blackpool, and of their coach journeys there and back with other PCs and WPCs; in episode 692 there are several scenes of Tracy and Anthony indoors at a hairdressing competition in Wembley, London (not necessarily recorded in London); and episode 699 features one scene outside, and several inside, the Manchester flat to which Cheryl has moved and at which Jonathan has tracked her down (again, not necessarily recorded in Manchester).

Births:

None. Sue's baby is due on 3rd September (671). It is Annabelle's birthday soon (678, 680), and she celebrates it in episode 688. It is Rod's 21st birthday on Saturday (688), and he celebrates it somewhat misguidedly in episode 689. Jessica Choi's birthday is next week in episode 697, and is celebrated in episode 698. It is Doreen's birthday in episode 706, when she claims that she was 41 before realising running away wasn't the answer. Harry is 70 in episode 697, it is his birthday in episode 707, and in episode 708 he is 71 and 3 days - which would mean that he was born on 2nd August 1918.

Two. Two weeks away in episode 672, the wedding of Gerald Mainwaring Fallon and Mona Winifred Harvey takes place in episode 677; and, booked for 8 am on 5th August, a bank holiday, in episode 686, which is nine weeks away in episode 690, the wedding of Terry Sullivan and Sue Harper takes place in episode 708, a Saturday (707). We are also told that Edna and Harry were married for 45 years (697), Margaret and Tony have been married for 20 years (704), and it is two years since Jonathan and Laura's wedding (707). It is Billy's 22nd wedding anniversary in episode 677, and in episode 708 Mick says his wedding was "one too many". In episode 703, the wedding of Rod and Kirsty was meant to have taken place "last Saturday" - and might well have done, but for some unfortunate occurrences beforehand! .

Deaths:

Four. In episode 675, two car drivers die following a road accident attended by Rod - although one of them, Victor, has time for a very long conversation with Rod first. Mrs Edwards' husband, Arthur, has died in his bed, holding his cocoa and the Echo, in episode 677; and the woman who suffers a heart attack in the supermarket car park in episode 693 cannot be saved even though a doctor (Michael) and a horrible car rug (Alison's) are both nearby - she dies in intensive care.

Jonathan (670); Nisha (684); Chrissy (685); Sue (690 and 699); Tracy (692); Sammy (695); Sheila (708) and an unnamed female wedding guest (708). It's worth noting also that Sinbad is seen stepping in dog muck, becoming the first character to do so (maybe in ANY soap!) in episode 695.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Len/Lenny, Frank's mate (684, 685); Dr Holmes, Michael's partner at the practice (689); Terry's late mother, who used to say it was lucky for a bird to plop on you (690); and Judith, who works for Keith (706).

Goofs:

Paul uses his own unique pronunciation of "Sonia" - to rhyme with "begonia" - again in episode 680.

Nisha misses out the word "ago" in episode 683: "Seeing as the French Revolution happened almost 200 years to the day".

When Caroline says "The headline's at seven" in episode 689, she probably means "deadline".

Cheryl misses out the letter "G" while listing the other letters of the alphabet as far as "J" in episode 692.

Sinbad refers in episode 699 to a "mutant teenage", rather than a "teenage mutant", ninja turtle.

Perhaps Tommo has been renamed by episode 705, in which Sergeant Appleby is the second character who refers to him as Thomson instead of Tomlinson.

In episode 707, Edna's gravestone has different wording from that seen on several previous occasions, no longer stating her date of birth.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

One of the funniest moments in twenty-one years of "Brookside" occurs in episode 688, in which Jimmy and Sinbad are delivering a new mattress for Billy. When Sinbad points out, with little time to spare, that they are approaching a red light, Jimmy brakes suddenly, and Sinbad accidentally lets go of the string which is holding the mattress on the roof. It flies off onto the other side of the road, where it is immediately driven over by a lorry coming the other way.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Doreen realises that, despite all her efforts to persuade him otherwise, Billy has decided to join Sheila on her holiday to Ireland. She begins to put away in the wardrobe some of the clothes he has left on the bed, no doubt considering what to do next.......
