The storylines:

Torn between two job opportunities, Frank picks the riskier one, and doesn't realise that, when she isn't campaigning with Paul against the building of shops nearby, or trying to help Sammy with her drinking problem, Chrissy is seeing another man. He does, however, notice some of Growler's mischief, and that Katie has taken up the trombone. Sue is depressed when baby Daniel contracts meningitis, and even more so when she can't get pregnant again. She helps Jonathan to avoid being too deeply implicated with a money-laundering client, but this leads to the end of his partnership with Sarah, and to him having to sell one of his properties, possibly the one where Sue and Terry are living! Another house goes on the market too, as Caroline leaves the Close for London, following a few business difficulties and the death of James - who caused them - and Michael prepares to leave for America with Jessica and Alison. Sheila and Billy's problems include differing religious outlooks, disapproving relatives, unexpected revelations and the harbouring of the odd army deserter, but ultimately they decide to marry. While Harry takes a trip to America to attend another wedding - Ralph and Lana's - Mick loses his dog, Monty, and, after all else fails, tries to train up a lookalike replacement before he returns. Louise hopes the return of Annabelle from extended stays in Kendal and France will enable her to become part of the Collins family, but when Lucy comes home too, the prospect doesn't look quite as appealing, or as likely to happen.......

The dates:

It is a bank holiday in episode 752, 15th January in episode 756, 16th January in episode 757, and Chinese New Year in episode 759. It is February 7th in episode 763, as it is mentioned in episode 758 that the tender winner will be announced, and Frank's interview will take place, on that date. As this is "tomorrow" in episode 762, it must then be February 6th! It is Valentine's Day in episode 765, and March 1990 in episode 772. In episode 769 Harry says he is leaving for America on 21st March, which happens in episode 775. The letter Billy receives in episode 773 is dated 7th March 1990; and, based on dialogue in episode 776, it is Wednesday in episode 777. It is Lent in episode 780, and, based on dialogue in episode 779, Monday. Mick is told that Harry is coming back on 14th May, which is two weeks' time rather than three, in episode 786. It is April 1990 in episodes 786, 787 and 789; Wednesday in episode 787; and Bank Holiday Monday in episode 788.

Goofs:

At one point in episode 766, Terry says "Roy" when he means "Ray".

In episode 787, Mick consults the list Harry left him to see what Monty's Wednesday meal ought to be, and finds that it is chicken and liver. Unfortunately, when Harry put together that list in episode 769, it was BEEF and liver for Mondays and Wednesdays, chicken for Tuesdays and Thursdays!

In episode 788, when Lucy is criticising Paul's approach to Louise, she says he keeps "taking her aside" instead of "taking her side".

Sue rips her calendar, originally seen in episode 786, off the wall and tears it up in episode 787; but in episode 789 it has magically been restored to its original position and condition.

Trivia:

Caroline's business, "Choi Industries" (772), is run by James, a trained accountant (753). The video Sinbad takes from his car boot and gives her to watch is "The Mutilator" (755, 756). Sinbad asks for three sugars in his tea (768 ), and claims, fictitiously, that he has a broker called Hugo (753). Having heard that Caroline is looking for new markets for her jewellery, he puts down a deposit on a stall on Paddy's Market, on the corner of Great Ormond Street (754). Shelley Style, based in Newcastle, contact James expressing interest (759); and he insists on answering when someone calls Caroline from Seren Design (760), the firm she later visits (774) and through which he is swindling her. After she leaves for London, Alison and Hattie move in, and Hattie puts up a poster of Jason Donovan (784). The Chois' "for sale" sign bears the name "G. Samuels" (the firm where Chrissy works!) and the telephone number 051 259 6971 (784, 786). [Maybe they changed their number because they were getting too many calls for Brian Lawrence....]

Chrissy was in Liverpool (783) on a teacher-training course when she found out she was expecting Sammy (775). Other tenders for the maintenance contract are from Macintyre Lyneham and Rutherford's, and other firms likely to be interested are Arlotts and Marshall Motors (753). The door of the managing director's office, which has been broken into, bears the name G.I. Thompson (754). Dave, a member of the co-operative, is married (754). Sammy is reading Shakespeare's "Hamlet" for general studies (780). Frannie (Kav) was Mrs Kavanagh's only son (766), which means that he must have been inventing the brother he had mentioned to Sammy in episode 724. She tells the court he had claimed the car that crashed was his brother's (766) - although he had actually said in episode 727 that it was his cousin's! Ronnie lives at 24 Skeffington Court, Manor Park (766), while Growler's girlfriend Kim used to live in Birkenhead (759), and most of Dr O'Rourke's relatives are in Canada (783).

Jonathan's "for sale" sign bears the name "Binenan Estates" and the telephone number 051 259 9106 (786). He asks for the "Marriott file" (771), while Viv is dealing with the "Gilmore case" (774). Jonathan used to play rugby with Guy MacLeish (774). Guy's business is the MacLeish Jersey Corporation (752, 775), and one of the businesses he bought - twice over - was H.G. Pearson (Builders' Merchants), Runcorn (774). Terry's dad used to help him make Airfix kits (777); Louise has never been to France, but did go to London once to see her mum (786); Harry met Edna on his 21st birthday (765); Barry reads the "Daily Mirror" (764); Susan met Bobby at a conference, and is now pregnant with his child (769); Linda Spencer, teacher at the school for the deaf, has no children (756), and Sheila tells her that she was late for work because there was an accident on Queens Drive (757); and Jonathan (754, 770), Billy (765), Harry (770) and Sue (775), are all right-handed.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Mrs Mackay tells Paul, Annabelle and Gordon that if they are to foster Louise it must be a long-term commitment, not just an attempt to help her out of her current jam. Gordon doesn't want to abandon the girl, and Annabelle thinks they should think about it and sleep on it, although she is in favour of fostering her. But Paul is against the idea, and is certain that Lucy would be too.......

The final image of episode 789, which fades into the closing credits, is of Doreen Sloane, making the last of her 392 appearances as Annabelle Collins. The actress died of cancer on April 8th 1990, and it was announced before the original Channel Four broadcast of episode 785 on April 25th 1990 that it was the first of three recorded shortly before her death, and that she would be greatly missed by everyone at Mersey Televsion, and by her many fans.
