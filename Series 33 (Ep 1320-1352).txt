Episode 1352 ends with an alphabetical listing of the whole year's team, instead of the normal cast list, over images of a crowd of wavers, gradually increasing in number, on the Parade.

The storylines:

Bev gives birth to Ron's son (or possibly his grandson), Marianne gets her revenge on Charles, and Brian is arrested. Barry spoils Terry's plans to marry Anna by forcing her to leave the country, and Jimmy spoils Lyn and Frank's wedding day by getting high on drugs and causing a car crash, which kills Frank and leaves Tony in a coma. As the residents try to raise money in a variety of ways to pay for treatment to help Tony recover, Katie falls under the influence of dubious newcomer Simon, threatening her friendship with Jacqui; and the Close does not prove to be a very effective refuge for Penny following the suicide of husband Clive. Sinbad is concerned when Mandy begins to have regrets about what she has done, but Beth is more keen to move on with her life, and believes she has fallen in love.......with Margaret!

The dates:

Dialogue in episode 1321 belatedly reveals that the events of episode 1290 took place on 9th August; and, based on dialogue in episode 1320, it is Friday in episode 1322. It is Friday again, and three months until January, in episode 1325; and, based on dialogue and images in these and other episodes, it is Wednesday 3rd November 1993, then Thursday 4th November 1993, in episode 1326, and Friday 5th November 1993 in episodes 1327 and 1328. Based on dialogue in episode 1329, it is Wednesday in episode 1330; based on dialogue in episode 1333, it is Friday in episode 1334; and it is the "European Year of the Older Person" in episode 1335. It is a month till Christmas in episode 1336, it is a couple of weeks till Christmas in episode 1343, and it is Christmas next week in episode 1346, in which, on the basis of dialogue in episode 1347, when New Year's Eve is "this time next week", it is a Friday. It is Christmas Eve 1993 in episode 1348; it is still Christmas Eve, then Christmas Day, in episode 1349; and, apart from the last few minutes, when it is New Year's Day, it is New Year's Eve ("next Friday" in episodes 1350 and 1351) in episode 1352.

Locations:

While most of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, there are interior-only scenes set in Preston, but not necessarily recorded there, in episode 1321; scenes in Banbury in episodes 1323, 1325, 1326 and 1337; and scenes in Oldham (though not recognisably so) in episode 1350.

Births:

One - the yet-to-be-named Josh McLoughlin is born prematurely on Christmas Day in episode 1349, although he was not due for another 2 months in episode 1347. Lyn reveals that she is pregnant in episode 1336, but falls down the stairs in episode 1344, and it emerges that she has lost the baby in episode 1345. The date of birth of Tony, a teenager (1348), appears to be 6/3/79, according to the chart on the wall behind his bed (1329). It is Jackie's 40th birthday in episode 1338, which is "next week" in episode 1337; and Ron's birthday is on Christmas Day in episode 1349. We are also told that Tracy is 24 (1335); Penny is 47, according to Keith's newspaper (1336); Gavin is 14 (1339); and, based on his coffin-plate, Frank was 47 when he died (1332).

Marriages:

One - Frank Rogers marries Lyn Matthews in episode 1327, which, based on earlier dialogue, is Friday 5th November 1993. This marriage is "a couple of weeks" away in episode 1320, "next week" and "two weeks to go" in episode 1323, in which Frank and Chrissy are officially divorced, and "tomorrow" and "30 hours away" in episode 1326. We are told in episode 1329 that it lasted for 15 minutes - which would surely make it the shortest marriage in the 21-year history of "Brookside"! Terry and Anna intend to marry on New Year's Eve, which is a Friday (1348, 1350, 1351), but Barry forces her to leave the country instead (1352). We are also told that Penny and Clive had been married for 15 years (1327), and that it was Jackie and Jimmy's wedding anniversary yesterday (1340).

Deaths:

Two - Clive Crosbie MP is the fifth "Brookside" character to commit suicide, found dead in his exhaust fumes-filled car in episode 1325; then Frank Rogers is the eighth character to be killed in a car crash, in episode 1328. The inscription on his coffin-plate reads "Frank Rogers, Died 5th November 1993, Aged 47 Years" (1332). A gravestone seen for the first time in episode 1331 reads "Trevor Jordache, Husband, Father and Loving Brother, 1947-1993 " - the wording that Brenna had recommended in an earlier episode. Sinbad says Trevor died six months ago, while Terry says it was more like three months ago (1333); and in episode 1345 Julia mentions that Cyril died two years ago this new year. Unseen characters that are no longer alive, but are mentioned in this season are: Frank's father (1330); and Julia's husband Arthur, who died 20 years ago (1336) and whose clothes she kept for the next three years (1340).

Toilet visits:

Julia (1321); David (1321 - and, according to Jean, he has already been three times in the last hour!); Geoff (1322); Terry (1322); Jackie (1323); Simon (1325 and 1333); DD (1326 OOV): Rachel, who finds that there is no toilet roll (1331); Keith (1344); Julia again, twice (1345); and two men, in adjacent urinols (1351). Patricia claims that the builders are in and out of the loo all the time in episode 1320.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Simon's parents (1339).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Rod (1320); Diana (1320); Tracy (1320, 1324); Ellis (1321); Bobby (1321); Fran (1321, 1332, 1333); Steven (1321, 1333, 1334); Cyril (1322, 1345); Lindsey (1322); Bev and Lyn's mother / Mrs McLoughlin (1323, 1328, 1331, 1332, 1334, 1338, 1339, 1340, 1341, 1344, 1345, 1346, 1352 / 1325); Trevor (1331, 1347); Brenna (1331); Peter Harrison (1323, 1334, 1341, 1350); Derek (1335, 1338, 1339); Joe Halsall (1338); Billy (1338); Owen's mother (1344, 1345); Owen's father (1344); Nick, Lyn's brother (1346); Harry Cross (1346); Thomas (1346); Mrs Shackleton (1347); and Leanne (1351).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Freddie Bell, the builders' gaffer (1320); Charles's mother (1323); Becky and Roseanne, Keith's sisters (1330); Keith's father (1330, 1331); Frank's uncle Stan (1330); Jane and Michael Summerfield, ex-friends of Penny (1331); Clive's secretary (1331); Rita, barmaid (1333); Suze, compere (1335); Mrs Feechan's husband (1337); Tim Scott, Clive's FD (1337, 1338, 1340); Penny's father (1338); Simon's brother and sister (1339); Simon's friend Brian's father, mother and brothers (1339); Mrs Kerfoot, who wanted Julia to sing "Once In Royal David's City" (1340); Keith's grandfather (1341, 1351); and Anna's mother and father (1350).

Goofs:

Ron says "in" instead of "from" in episode 1335: "All the way in Romania".

Terry probably means "ever" instead of "always" in episode 1339: "He's dumped on every woman he's always been with".

Trivia:

DD has previously nursed Tony through measles, tonsilitis and chicken pox (1336). Mike and Keith try to run a promotions business, "M&K Promotions" (1331, 1332, 1335). Their photo of Penny is seen in a newspaper which appears to be dated Friday December 10th 1993, with the headline "WIFE OF SHAMED MP IN HIDING" (1343). Mike is giving Jacqui a CD by R.E.M. for Christmas, even though she asked for one by Whitney Houston - and he gets Margaret to make him a tape of it on Max's stereo first! (1346). Julia collects jumble for St Thomas's Christmas Fayre in episode 1340, the fayre takes place in episode 1341, then she passes on to the Tony fund a cheque for the proceeds raised, £111.42, in episode 1342.

After his Morris Oxford, David had a Cortina in 1961, when he was promoted and drove to the Western Isles (1340).

He has five GCSEs (1322), has been on income support for the last six months (1325), and says than his parents split up and have divorced (1339, 1340). He gives Katie, who buys two packets of condoms, each costing £2.59 (1351), a bible inscribed "Dear Katie, Jesus led you to me, now let me lead you to Him. True love always, Simon (1345, 1346). Lyn has been working as a doctors' receptionist for seven and a half months (1338). The Rogers' telephone number, according to Geoff's "For Sale" sign, is 238 5484 (1346).

House "For Sale" signs, bearing the name "Shannon Estates" and the telephone number 051 269 5610, are erected at the Rogers' AND the Jordaches' in episode 1347. Mandy met Trevor when she was 16, whereas Beth was 14 when he raped her (1334). Mrs Feechan lives at number 22 (1337). The last digit of the telephone number of Fletcher's is not visible on the "To Let" sign on the salon, but the others are 051 676 886 (1336); and a skip, partially seen from the side in episode 1345, bears the name "....& McEwan" and the telephone number 647 3311.

Jimmy has previously been to Torremolinos (1328). Terry is a Liverpool supporter (1352). Barry is left-handed (1322). Oscar is a big fan of Right Said Fred and "Doctor Who" (1335). Eddie Blakeson's poetry includes "Hey, hey, hey, it's Giro Day" (1335). Anna, who looks like her mother (1350), arrived in Britain on 22nd August 1988, according to Immigration records (1351). In his report to the Board, Charles refers to the (recent) period from September 1988 to September 1993 (1323). Marianne is twice seen reading the book "Body And Soul" by Anita Roddick in episode 1351.


"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

It has taken more than eleven years, but in episode 1334 Mike Dixon becomes the first "Brookside" character to be heard farting.

There seems to be a very subtle reminder of Geoff's problems with writing in a scene in which he sells Frank's car to David in episode 1346. After Geoff removes from the car window a sign saying "For Sale - Tel. 238 5484", the reverse side of it, reading only "TEL 238 54", is visible. Presumably this is an earlier attempt, in which he didn't leave enough space for the whole number, nor realise that he would need to make it clear that the car was for sale!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

At Mick's party, Beth is not impressed to discover that Margaret is going to sneak back into the Farnhams' with Keith, apparently with the intention of seeing in the new year by sleeping with him. She accuses Margaret of only taking such extreme measures because she wants people to think she goes out with boys rather than girls. But Margaret and Keith leave together anyway, and all Beth can add, sarcastically, is "Happy New Year".......
