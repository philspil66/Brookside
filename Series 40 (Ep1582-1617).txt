In episode 1601 Beth is heard, but only seen as a body, played by a stand-in. Words of Beth and Mandy that were originally heard in episode 1600 are also repeated in episode 1601, as Mandy remembers one of their last conversations.

The storylines:

As one of "Brookside"'s best years continues, Jacqui puts her friendship with Katie at risk, and Mike out of a job, in order to set up in business with new friend Peter. Max and Patricia also have a new business partner, the dubious Dil - while Ron goes bungee jumping, has an angina attack, and begins to worry about Bev's fidelity. Meanwhile, Rosie is hospitalised, then devastated to learn that she has lost not only the baby she was carrying, but also her womb. Jimmy pays Carl to keep him out of prison, and buys number 10 for Jackie - but she throws him out after his attempts to persuade her to move become more and more misguided. Mick's arguably equally misguided attempts to free himself from the unwanted and increasingly deranged attentions of Jenny include letting her move in with him - and, although she undergoes counselling, it becomes clear that she is still determined to somehow persuade him that neither of them are ever meant to be with anyone else. Beth is evidently never meant to find happiness - she dies in prison, of a hereditary heart condition. However, after Rachel finally admits the truth about Trevor, Mandy is released, and agrees to marry Sinbad. Unfortunately, Brenna returns, wanting revenge for the death of her brother. How successful will she be?

The dates:

Jimmy dates the agreement he is seen signing in episode 1586 "21/6/95"; and, based on dialogue in episode 1585, it is Friday in episode 1587. Based on dialogue in episode 1587, Mandy and Beth were convicted in May, and it is Tuesday in episode 1588, when it is "the middle of summer". It is still summer, according to the "Gift Box" sale sign, in episode 1598; and, based on dialogue in episode 1603, it is Tuesday in episode 1604. Based on dialogue in episode 1605, it is Tuesday again in episode 1606; based on dialogue in episode 1607, in which events of episode 1606 were "last night", it must be Wednesday in episode 1607; and based on dialogue in episode 1614, it is Friday 1st September in episode 1617. And, as the wedding is "tomorrow" in episode 1616, it must then be Thursday 31st August.

Locations:

In episodes 1595 and 1599 there are scenes set in the Yorkshire prison to which Beth and Mandy have been transferred; the latter episode also includes scenes of Sinbad and David in various locations en route from Liverpool to this prison; episodes 1600 to 1603 feature London-based scenes in another prison, in a hotel room, and inside and outside the Court Of Appeal; and episode 1615 features scenes of Jenny and John at the latter's home in Nottingham. However, any or all of these scenes may actually have been recorded in or near Liverpool, where the rest of the action in this season is set, as there is nothing about any of them that would suggest otherwise. The furthest afield that anyone else is seen is Southport, in episodes 1591, 1592 and 1593.

Births:

None. Rosie is 18 weeks pregnant in episode 1586, and five months pregnant in episode 1589, but in episode 1594 it emerges that the baby she has been carrying is dead. Mandy is eight months pregnant in episode 1609, and it is her birthday, which is "next week" in episodes 1586 and 1589, and "yesterday" in episode 1593, in episode 1592. It is Carl's birthday in episode 1595, and it is Alice's birthday in episode 1612. We are also told that Rosie is 40 (1596); David is "a year or so" older than Jean (1598); Lee is 16 (1603); Becca is 5 (1603); and Beth was 19 (1607). Jenny claims, fictitiously, that it would have been her late mother's birthday tomorrow in episode 1615.

Marriages:

None. Sinbad is due to marry Mandy "next weekend" (1613) / "next Friday" and "Friday 1st September" (1614) / "in 3 days, 4 hours and 40 minutes" (1615) / "tomorrow" (1616). But, for various reasons, the wedding doesn't happen (1617). We are also told that Janice's parents are divorced (1612), and that Dil is split from his wife (1615).

Deaths:

Three - Beth Jordache dies, aged 19 (1607) of a hereditary heart condition in episode 1601, which was "three days ago" in episode 1602; Ben, a rat Jimmy has borrowed, is killed by Polly, the cat, in episode 1607; and, after Jimmy has obtained a not-quite-lookalike replacement "Ben", Polly kills that one too in episode 1608!

Goofs:

When episode 1588 was originally aired on Tuesday 27th June 1995, its sound effects were unfortunately missing! Jacqui, while naked, hears Shaun knocking on her door; and, on two separate occasions, he hears his mobile phone ringing - but the viewers don't!! This fault was, however, corrected for subsequent broadcasts of this episode, including the omnibus edition shown on Saturday 1st July 1995.

Eddie omits one of two adjacent "in"s in episode 1590: "They just want to talk to Carl about the explosion he got caught up in Widnes"

In episode 1599, Alison refers to "the time of the killingS". Just how many Trevor Jordaches does she think died??

Ron often refers to his daughter as "Jacqueline" and his shop assistant as "Jackie", especially when talking about them to others - but, when speaking to Bev in episode 1606, he misleadingly says "Have our Michael and Jacqueline gone?". It is Jackie who has just visited him following his collapse, as Jacqui is on holiday in Magaluf!

Trivia:

Jean was an only child (1584). She and David have life savings of £2,000 in the Post Office, £1,500 in "Granny Bonds" and £500 of [British] Gas shares (1616), and shop at Tesco's (1607). David's planned route to the Yorkshire prison, in which Beth and Mandy are in "A" wing, includes the A59 and the B525 (1599). The letter from Trevor to Rachel seen in episode 1587 indicates that his last known address was 17 Bexton Avenue, Manchester, and that he was writing from HM Prison, Kingston, Manchester. A reference number quoted, to be written on the envelope when replying, is GF 5927.

The coach carrying the protesters in episode 1590 is from Tierney Brothers, Liverpool 051 928 9818. Dr McElhone has worked with abused children for 30 years (1602). Brenna implies that she used to be a midwife (1613). Alison is right-handed (1602); so is Mandy (1610); and so is the unnamed, uncredited reporter who covers the story of Jackie and Jean at the prison (1587).

Rachel gets some "E"s in her GCSEs (1615). She has tests at the "Royal" (1609), the same hospital to which Carl is admitted (1582). The address Eddie obtains to write to regarding adoption is 32 Digler Street (1603). Bev, who had a crush on Freddie Mercury for ten years (1607), and Ron, who is right-handed (1603), and whose favourite soup is tomato (1608), attend the "Sandcastles Nursery Open Day" (1603).

Dil is right-handed (1613), as is Shaun (1593), whose business, based on the logo appearing at the end of the video made for Smith and Windsor (1593, 1594), light manufacturers (1590) is "SBV Video Productions" (1590). Jacqui, who has been shopping at Boots' (1594), and Katie, who has a poster of Saint Etienne in her room (1595), still have an Oasis poster on the back of their door (1583, 1591, 1592, 1594). Matt Munro is one of Julia's favourite singers (1614).

Jimmy is left-handed (1586), and never passed an exam (1615). Mick, who is right-handed (1590), receives a book, "First Love, Last Rites" from Jenny, in which she has written "To Mick - Thanks for everything. I couldn't have done it without you. Love, Jenny" (1615). Her flat is number 4 (1594, 1596, 1607). The end-of-term revue which Mr Thornton is producing is called "Desert Island Disco" (1586). Janice's telephone number is 692-6149 (1613).

There are three newspaper headlines seen on-screen in this season: "FIREMAN INJURED IN WIDNES BLAST", from the "Daily Post" (1582); "ALL TIED UP - Women In Prison Sit-In" (1588); and "Local Shopkeeper In Bungee Fundraiser" (1606). Taxis from Manor Car Line, bearing the number 269 6699, are seen again in episodes 1587 and 1617.

We see again the pizza parlour's telephone number, 051 269 2434 and the florists' number, 269 3626, on Mick's van for the last time in episode 1584. The numbers then become 0151 269 2434 (1600, 1615) and 0151 269 3626 (1600, 1607), the latter being accompanied by the "Gift Box" logo. A "For Sale" sign, bearing the name "D.O.A. Estates" and the telephone number 0151 269 7740, is erected outside number 10 in episode 1608, and is still there in episodes 1609, 1610, 1611 and 1617.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 1582, Mick is baffled when Jenny appears in the pizza parlour moments after he has received another silent telephone call which he believes is from her. However, for little more than a split second, viewers are able to see inside the bag Jenny is carrying.......and there's a mobile phone in there!

In episode 1586, a pupil whose face is entirely concealed by a huge horse-head mask is praised and sent elsewhere by Mr Thornton, who then asks Mick to take a seat outside his office until he is free to see him. As Mick complies, the pupil can be seen gingerly going on his way, then walking straight into a wall.......

The poster seen in episodes 1588, 1589, 1590 and 1591 was apparently produced by a misuser of apostrophes: it reads "FREE THE JORDACHE'S". And, while Jackie and Rosie are talking to the police in episode 1592, one of the protesters behind them is juggling.

There are several moments in episode 1610 in which Brenna can be seen unsuccessfully trying to put something poisonous into a mug from which she expects Mandy to drink, or into the soup she plans to serve up to her, without anyone noticing. Similarly, while she speaks right at the end of episode 1612, she is adding powder to another drink for Mandy!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As Jenny holds Mick at gunpoint in his flat, the wedding guests return to the Close with Sinbad, who has forgotten his key. Eddie, just back from Florida, offers to help to get the back door open, but when he isn't successful, Jimmy's expertise in housebreaking is called upon instead. Once inside, Sinbad and Rachel are horrified to discover that, following an earlier altercation with Brenna, Mandy is lying unconscious at the foot of the stairs.......
