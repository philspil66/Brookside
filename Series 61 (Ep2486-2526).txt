The Magic Rabbits are seen again in episode 2486 (watched by Kylie and Wills) and in episode 2510 (watched by Anthony).

A number of images of Bev and Fred in different outfits are rapidly flashed on-screen in episode 2496, to reflect their being photographed, purportedly over the course of several past years, by Lance; images of Diane are seen while Brigid is heard confessing to her priest in episode 2502; and Anthea is briefly seen in slow-motion towards the end of episode 2526, with her line, "Ron!", echoing.

For scheduling reasons, eighteen episodes (2492/2493, 2496/2497, 2502/2503, 2505/2506, 2511/2512, 2513/2514, 2516/2517, 2519/2520, 2522/2523) were originally broadcast on Channel Four edited into nine double-length omnibuses, each in a 60-minute time-slot.

The storylines:

After serving time for her, Tim marries Emily; and, after it seems like a good idea at the time, Bev marries Lance's boyfriend Fred, hoping to help him to be able to stay in the country. Vonnie moves in with Mick, and Leo leaves for London, after having sex with 15-year-old Adele. Diane and Marty decide to have IVF treatment to improve their chances of conceiving, Anthony is forced to steal by two girls at school, and Steve gets a job at Katrina's father's garage. Jimmy and Jackie are heading towards divorce, and Jerome is frequently heading towards Nisha, although Nikki can't bring herself to confront them. Relationships with the brothers Moffat cause more conflict between Katie, who prepares to leave the Close for a new life with Clint, and Jacqui, who eventually discovers that Robbie is dangerously and obsessively violent, and partly responsible for Ron, Anthea, Jessie, Ray, Kitty and Mike being subjected to frightening ordeals in the Dixon home. And while most of them are gradually able to put these terrible times behind them, Kitty may never be the same again, and Ron's plans to guard the future safety of his family include getting himself a gun. And he's prepared to use it.......

Locations:

All the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, the furthest afield any characters are seen being Southport, in episodes 2496 and 2497.

Births:

None, although we are told in episode 2510 that the unseen Becky Watkins got pregnant by an equally unseen Spaniard, and we are told in episode 2525 that Vonnie's unseen friend Lauren in Bradford has recently given birth to an equally unseen baby! It is Katie's 25th birthday in episode 2492; it is Mick's 42nd birthday in episode 2501; it is Rachel's birthday in episode 2504; and it is Diane's 37th birthday - which is "in a couple of weeks" in episode 2501, and "this Friday" in episode 2508 - in episode 2509. We are also told that Emily is 17 (2493, 2515), and 18 in a few months (2525); Clint is 23 (2500); Adele is 15 (2503, 2508, 2510, 2513), and 16 in September (2512); Anthea is 47 (2508); Robbie is 25 (2519); Craig is 19 (2526); Beth is 14 months old (2497) / 18 months old, according to Jimmy (2499); Jackie is "well into her forties" according to Diane (2505); and the war was over by the time Ron was born (2526). Susannah's gravestone, seen in episode 2508, indicates that she was born in 1960.

Marriages:

Two. The twentieth "Brookside" wedding, albeit not necessarily the most genuine, takes place in episode 2493, as Bev McLoughlin marries Fred Gonzales; and the twenty-first takes place in episode 2524, as Timothy O'Leary marries Emily Margaret Shadwick at Merseyside Register Office (2524) on Friday (2523, 2524) 4th May 2001 (2524). We are also told that Brigid attended the wedding of Steve's auntie Moira (2487); Jackie and Jimmy have been married for 27 years (2493, 2496, 2521); Christy was married for six months (2497), and is now divorced (2503); Diane and Marty have been married for seven years (2504); and Vonnie was married to the unseen Frank for nearly 22 years (2506). A frustrated Max over-states his involvement with Susannah as "20 years of marriage" (2508); and Jeff would be coming up to his silver wedding, if his wife hadn't just left him (2511).

Deaths:

One, at the end of episode 2526, in Ron's house - but who is it? The answer will be revealed at the beginning of the next season....... Susannah's gravestone, seen in episode 2508, indicates that she died in 2000. Unseen characters who are no longer alive but are mentioned are Franky (2488) / Jimmy's big brother, who died 20-odd years ago (2499); and Frank (2495) / Jerome's father (2505). Jacqui claims it is three years ago that Matthew and Emily died in episode 2514 - but see "Goofs" below!

Toilet visits:

Victoria (2496); Christy (2497); Kitty (2497 - accidentally); Mike (2505 - using a bucket / 2507 - using a commode); Leo (2512); Robbie (2517); Steve (2520) and Ron (2526 - partly to avoid buying Jerome a drink). Nikki claims to be going to the toilet in episode 2526, but she is just using it as a convenient location for getting drunk.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Marty's first wife (2504); and Clint and Robbie's mother (2512, 2513, 2515, 2524, 2526).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Shelley (2486, 2493, 2494, 2495, 2496, 2506, 2507, 2508, 2521); Dave / Dave Burns (2486, 2493, 2498, 2513, 2526 / 2491, 2492, 2508, 2525); Lance's father (2486); DD (2488); Billy (2488); Susannah / Susannah Morrisey (2489, 2491, 2492, 2493, 2495, 2500, 2513, 2515, 2520, 2525 / 2495); Luke Musgrove / Luke (2492, 2511, 2513 / 2507, 2510), Ryan Musgrove / Ryan (2507, 2511 / 2510), the Musgrove brothers (2510); Kathy (2494); Nathan (2500, 2512, 2515, 2517, 2518, 2520, 2521, 2522); Val (2506, 2508, 2516, 2517, 2519, 2521, 2522, 2523, 2524); Lisa's mother (2508); Ian Leigh (2508); Sammy (2511); Geoff (2511); Bernard (2511) / Ray's brother (2518); Bernie (2512); Sinbad (2513, 2521); Katrina's mother / Julie (2511, 2513 / 2514); Matthew and Emily (2514); Jason (2514); Kiev (2517); Victoria's mother-in-law (2524); Mandy (2525); Trevor Jordache (2525); Bev's mother (2526); and Ron's father (2526).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Miss Bowcock, Josh's teacher (2486); Trisha, a sick pump attendant (2486); Gary Russell, a weird friend of Josh (2486); Clayton, a mate of Lance (2486); Mark Woods, a school-mate of Bev (2486); Lance's nan (2487); Steve's auntie Moira (2487); Tony, Amber's husband (2488); Tommy, Cheryl's husband (2488, 2489); Gerald Curran, Declan Goody, Tim Crane and Neil Marland, boys that Diane wanted to go out with (2489); Peter Lamont, who Adele fancies (2489); Mr Medway and Mr Jones, prison officers (2490); Mrs Sedgewick at school (2491); Fred's mother (2495); Debbie at the petrol station (2497); Mrs Denby, a "Great Grannies" client (2498); Keith Hyam, who Robbie glassed (2501); Father Mike, a less easy-going priest than Father Pat (2503); an uncle of Diane who had a breakdown (2503); Vinny, Marty's mate who had an affair with his first wife (2504); Stella, Vonnie's friend (2505); Brigid's husband (2508); Vinnie, a mate of Robbie in Benidorm (2508); Becky Watkins, a school-mate of Adele and Michelle who a Spaniard got pregnant (2510); Kirsty, Andrew, Grant and Betty, referred to in a radio broadcast (2510); Frank Fielder, the gaffer mechanic at Rock Ferry (2511); Katrina's auntie Pam (2511); Bernard's wife [Jean] (2511); Robbie and Clint's father (2512, 2513); Craig's mother (2513, 2524) and father (2524); Vonnie's sister in Bromley-by-Bow (2513); Miss Brown (2514) and Miss Phelan (2520), Anthony's teachers; Barney, Clint and Robbie's site foreman (2514); Amy Devereaux, a possibly invented friend of Emily, and her older brother (2515); Ben Connolly, a potential boyfriend for Michelle (2515); Mrs Davies and Mrs Kane, "Great Grannies" customers (2518); Pete, who will arrange a car for Steve (2520); salon employee Linda's kids (2524); Victoria's mother (2524); Lauren, a friend of Vonnie, and her recently-born baby (2525).

Goofs:

A mention in episode 2490 that events seen in episode 2489 took place "last night" contradicts all other indications that episode 2489 takes place on Friday, and episode 2490 on Valentine's Day (Wednesday).

Brigid's instruction to Marty in episode 2509 doesn't sound quite right: "Don't you go GETTING her indigestion!".

In episode 2514, Jacqui says that it was three years ago that Matthew and Emily died - but their deaths were actually four years earlier, in 1997.

The dates of the calls on the recent telephone bill that Jackie studies in episode 2522 are from over a year earlier: 01.04.00, 02.04.00 and 03.04.00.

Trivia:

Victoria says she bought one of her outfits at a shop in Matthew Street (2507); and Anthea, Jessie and Brigid plan to go to a big discount store in Lord Street which is closing down (2508). On 4th July 1986, Bev and her fellow school-leavers went to Southport - where she kissed Mark Woods, then puked (2486). The Southport pub at which the day-trippers meet in episode 2496 is the "Cock A Hoop". Christy's local is "The Swan" (2499, 2503), and he is now self-employed (2504). Robbie recalls the Dublin pub "Lily Bordelo's", at which he had a good night out a few years ago (2507), and "Churchill's", a posh bar in Benidorm run by a Scouser mate, Vinnie (2508). According to Cheryl, she and Amber have been drinking at the "Penny-Farthing" (2509). Amber is Cheryl's half-sister, and Jackie's cousin (2488). She has lost four and a half stone - or nineteen and a half stone, including her husband (2488). She claims that Jackie still owes her all but the first three of a year's weekly instalments of £1.55 on a dusky-pink satin camisole bought from her catalogue in 1979 (2488).

Jackie recalls that Jimmy first told her he loved her outside the "She" club on a wet Tuesday night, and their first home together was a flat above a fruit and veg shop (2506). Along with single calls to 0151 692 6974, 0151 692 6149, 0151 269 5341 and 0117 496 8496, she discovers the recurring number 0845 656 5980 on the Corkhills' telephone bill in episode 2522. Adele explains that this is the number Jimmy has to dial whenever he is connected to the internet (2522). He is seen with books "A Beginner's Guide To The PC" (2493) and "Complete Idiot's Guide - Internet - UK & Eire 2001" (2516), he uses the internet search engine "Sniffer Dog" to find 3,380 sites of "new york museums" (2518), and is looking at the website "Litherland Picture Post" when Jackie destroys his monitor (2522). Leanne claims that her spiritual awakening came from reading a book called "The Road Less Travelled" (2516), and recalls that Lance once had a dart stuck in his head, as her nan was a terrible shot (2487). Lance recalls that his father used to be in the army (2486).

The Murrays used to live in Meadowbank Road (2510), in Huyton (2488). Anthony was 4 years old when Diane first met him (2502); Diane's binmen come on Thursdays (2488); and Jerome's height is 6'1", according to Mick (2489). Katrina has no sisters (2515); Katie says that she has lived around here for twelve/thirteen years (2525); and Susannah's will was written in November 1998 (2500). Her sister's full name is Lisa Christine Morrisey (2515), and Emily's mother's full name is Margaret Marie Shadwick (2521). The document Emily uses to practise forging her mother's signature in episode 2521 shows a "Date of Registration" of 4th September 1999 [it is possibly her father's death certificate, which she and Tim realised earlier that they needed to find]. The prison at which Tim serves his sentence is H.M. Y.O.I. Longley (2517, 2521). His cell-mate Craig's mother plays whist on Fridays, and his father was the captain of a bowls team (2524). A letter to Margi seen in episode 2524 is from "Mr A. Byron, Chief Registrar" of the "Register for Births, Marriages and Deaths". Carl's business card describes him as a "Talent Scout" with "Technique Models", and shows the telephone number 0151 496 0003 and the mobile number 07700 900003 (2490).

Ron plays the track "Frigid Air Fanny" by George Formby, which he recalls was one of his father's favourites (2526). An invitation seen in episode 2500 reads "RESIDENTS MEETING TONIGHT AT 8 BROOKSIDE CLOSE, 8 PM - Unite in the fight against crime. Stop innocent people being terrorised in their own homes". The address IONA AVENUE, LIVERPOOL L70 4UQ and the telephone number 0151 496 0006 are seen again on the back of "Mersey Mover" buses in episodes 2502 and 2516; and the telephone number of Merseytravel, 0151-236 7676, is seen again on the bus shelter in episode 2511. There is still art by Robert Delaunay at Susannah's (2500), art by Mark Rothko (2487, 2500, 2511, 2521, 2522) and Richard Diebenkorn (2488, 2521, 2522, 2526) in Victoria's flat, and posters of Kate Bush in Adele's bedroom (2489, 2515). Leanne (2488), Fred (2495), Bev (2502, 2514) and Diane (2503), are left-handed; while Jerome (2495, 2520), Anthony (2498), Ron (2500, 2517), a CAMRA man (2503), Marty (2504), Anthea (2517), Robbie (2520) and Clint (2526) are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Two more of Gareth Roberts' scripts include subtle "Doctor Who" references - an unseen friend of Josh has the same name as a writer of the same range of "Doctor Who" books - Gary Russell - in episode 2486, and the dialogue of episode 2516 includes a "Doctor Who" story title, "The Creature From The Pit".

As the Yorkshire-based soap-opera formerly known as "Emmerdale Farm", but latterly renamed "Emmerdale", had featured a similar storyline just a few months earlier, Rachel's response in episode 2502, when Bev tells her that she has only married Fred to help to keep him in the country, surely belongs in the file marked "only 'Brookside' would ever dare to do this!":

Quote:

RACHEL: Did you get the idea off "Emmerdale Farm"?

BEV: No!


Robbie's words in the original broadcast of episode 2510, "She was seeing Ryan, and screwing Luke, at the same time.", are changed in the Saturday teatime omnibus repeat, in which a different recording of the same scene is used: "She was seeing Ryan, and doing Luke, at the same time.".

The letter addressed to Ms Jacqueline Dixon, Flat 3 Brookside Parade, Manor Park, Liverpool L43 6TZ, which Robbie opens in episode 2520, mis-spells Susannah's surname throughout. Briefly flashed on-screen, it reads as follows:

Dear Ms Dixon,

I have been instructed to contact you by Plumbwood Mowrem Solicitors, executors on behalf of Ms Susannah Morrissey. Ms Morrissey stated in her last will and testament that you, Miss Jacqui Dixon, should be made responsible for the financial undertakings of her children, Mr Harry Farnham and Miss Emma Farnham.

Ms Morrissey has opened several accounts at Royal Northern Bank on behalf of her children, and therefore we would request you to come and finalise the relevant details regarding the guardianship of the accounts. Please could you contact us as soon as possible and arrange an appointment with us.

Yours sincerely,

Mr Gerald Jones
Branch Manager


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Anthea, in a state of disbelief, follows Ron as he sets off down the stairs carrying a sawn-off shotgun, and tries to persuade him to come back up. She wants to call the police - but the telephone is downstairs. He tells her to stay back, and slowly enters the living room. Anthea shouts out to Ron, as a shadowy figure approaches him. Ron calls out "Get out, or I'll shoot!". And the gun fires. As it recoils, Ron drops it and falls to the floor. So does whoever he has hit.......
