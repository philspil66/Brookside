For scheduling reasons, ten episodes (2366/2367, 2380/2381, 2383/2384, 2386/2387, 2389/2390) were originally broadcast on Channel Four edited into five double-length omnibuses, each in a 60-minute time-slot.

For the special episodes which take place entirely in Benidorm (2365-2367), an eleventh "Brookside" opening sequence is used, in which ALL the images of Liverpool are replaced with images of Benidorm!

The appearances of David, Tony, Max, Harry, Peter and Andrew Collinge in episode 2376 are only within a superb series of twelve flashbacks from earlier episodes, as Jacqui fondly recalls the highlights of her ten years on the Close in just 30 seconds. And, although there is a large supporting cast in episode 2377, the highlights of a five-hour conversation between Nathan and Jacqui take up over half of that episode.

Musical juxtaposition occurs twice in this season - firstly, in episode 2357, the Matt Monro song "A Portrait of My Love", playing on Ray's radio in the caravan, continues in the background throughout the next scene, in which Emily and Tim talk and are reconciled at the bus stop, before we return to Jessie and Ray, still dancing to it, back in the caravan. And at the end of episode 2377, after we see the Dixons and their guests begin to sing "I Wish I Was Back In Liverpool", we continue to hear them while we see Jacqui walking out of Cuddington Hall for the last time, and Nathan watching her go.......

Some of the last images of episode 2389, featuring Lindsey running down a spiral staircase, are repeated, slightly blurred, as part of a sequence at the beginning of episode 2390, in which Lindsey has a short nightmare about her recent ordeal. Although this sequence otherwise consists of new material, it includes some images similar to those seen towards the end of episode 2389, but with the angles changed so that the guns Dave and Callum are holding now seem to her to be much closer, or much bigger, than they actually were!

The storylines:

This season sees the return, after long absences, of Leanne Powell and Nisha Batra, and some very promising new arrivals - Ray's mother Kitty, Leanne's brother Lance, and the Murray family! While Diane and Marty have trouble conceiving, Steve is a rival of Max for the affections of Katrina, and Leo has a new career in mind. Jessie and Ray eventually sleep together, and so do Shelley and Lindsey, after Dave ensures she will have nothing more to fear from Callum. After damaging Victoria's relationship with Darren by briefly getting her pregnant - she has an abortion - Dave also accidentally gets himself engaged to Bev, while Susannah gets engaged to Mick, although she is occasionally sleeping with Darren as well. Destroying Anthea's house helps Ron to get back together with her; Katie finds a new boyfriend, Clint, during Jacqui's hen party week in Benidorm; and, although Mike marries Rachel, Jacqui and Nathan decide not to tie the knot after all. While medical treatment and a job at "Bev's Bar" help to relieve Jimmy's depression, Tim is reluctantly dragged further into a life of crime by Emily, and becomes implicated in an attempt by the police to charge Sinbad with downloading child pornography, after Andrew is persuaded by his brother Kevin to make entirely false accusations of sexual abuse against him. And, although Sinbad has a number of loyal and unwavering supporters around the Close, others are more willing to keep an open mind about whether he has actually done what is alleged, and some are firmly of the view that he must be "guilty until proved innocent".......

The dates:

Episodes 2350 and 2351 take place earlier and later in the same day - which, based on earlier dialogue, must be a Wednesday. The ticket Rachel looks at in episode 2360 shows a date of 21 April 2000 for the return flight from Alacante to Manchester [but see "Goofs" below], and Jimmy tries to persuade people not to vote in the upcoming council election on May 4th in episode 2360. It is Good Friday in episode 2361; based on dialogue in episode 2369, it is Saturday in episode 2370; and the events at the end of episode 2370 continue directly in episode 2371, so it is still the same Saturday in that episode. From dialogue in episode 2375 and earlier episodes, it is 26th May in episode 2375 and 27th May in episode 2376; and the events at the end of episode 2376 continue directly in episode 2377, so it is still 27th May in that episode. Based on dialogue in episode 2383, it is Friday in episode 2385, in which it is Father's Day on Sunday; and in episode 2387, Shelley - not necessarily an expert on the subject - thinks the Olympics are a few weeks off. Episodes 2388 and 2389 take place on the same day - which, based on dialogue in episode 2398, was a Friday; based on dialogue in episodes 2390 and 2391, it is Thursday, then Friday, in episode 2391; and there is a 2000 calendar on the Johnsons' wall in episode 2395. Based on the markings on the Murrays' calendar, it is the 19th in episode 2399; and, based on dialogue in that episode, it is the following Friday [the 21st] in episode 2400.

Locations:

While the majority of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, there are many scenes set in and in the grounds of Cuddington Hall, Cheshire in episodes 2376 and 2377; and there are scenes in or near Bournemouth, and on a coach at a number of unspecified points between there and Liverpool, in episode 2382.

Births:

None. Victoria is pregnant by Dave, expecting a baby in November or December (2358), until she has an abortion in episode 2363. Ray reveals that but for the fact Renee once had an abortion, he could have had a child who would now be 36 (2364), Carolyn reveals that she lost a baby between Darren and his sister (2369), and Brigid reveals that she lost one before Diane (2388). It is Andrew's birthday in episode 2351; it is the yet-to-be-seen Jan's birthday in episode 2359; it is Bev's birthday in episode 2385; it is Jacqui's birthday - also mentioned in episode 2397, as Anthea has sent Ron to buy her a present - in episode 2398; and it is the birthday of the unseen Sarah, a friend of Adele, in episode 2384. We are told that Anthony is 9 (2350, 2356) / nearly 10 (2391); Emily is 16 (2353, 2354, 2357, 2364, 2379); Steve is 18 (2357); Victoria is 28 (2359); Jacqui is 23 (2365); Lindsey is 27 (2367) / in her late twenties (2384); Andrew is "not yet 10" (2371) / 9 (2387); Marty is over 40 (2381); Kitty is 84 (2382); and Tim is 19 (2388). Mrs Roebuck says she is the same age as her unseen daughter's unseen boyfriend Kieran (2369); Max claims that he "just about qualifies" as under-40 (2388); and Alasdair's coffin-plate indicates that he was born on 14th February 1953 (2390).

Marriages:

One - on 27th May, according to earlier dialogue, which is "in a fortnight" in episode 2365 and "tomorrow" in episode 2375, Mike marries Rachel is episode 2376; but the planned wedding of Jacqueline Teresa Dixon to Albert Nathan Cuddington, due to take place on the same day, is called off at the latest possible moment in the same episode, although we are told in episode 2378 that it was announced in "The Times". Max and Susannah are divorced in episode 2369, it is Ron and Anthea's first wedding anniversary in episode 2394, Susannah and Mick get engaged in episode 2397, and Dave and Bev get engaged in episode 2399. Ray says he was married for "30-odd" years in episode 2378, and Callum claims never to have been married in episode 2389 [but see "Goofs" below].

Deaths:

Four. While setting off by car to look for the Murrays' missing dog, Minty, Ray accidentally reverses over him in episode 2354; Alasdair and Rose Finnegan are both shot dead, victims of a gangland assassination in episode 2383; and Callum Finnegan is shot dead by Dave in episode 2389. Alasdair's coffin-plate, seen in episode 2390, reveals that he died on 13th June 2000. Unseen dead characters who are mentioned are: Adele's grandad, who died when she was one year old (2356); Ray's wife / missus / Renee (2354, 2383 / 2378 / 2364, 2382); Jimmy's brother Franky (2364); Darren's father, who was in the army (2369); Jerome's father (2373, 2393); Ray's uncle Ernest, who was a window cleaner (2378); Jessie's husband / Tommy (2359 / 2382), who has been dead for more than 20 years (2382) [but see "Goofs" below]; Billy Lowndes, a runner for Alasdair, who has also been shot dead (2384); "poor Mrs H" [Lil Harrington] (2385); and Cheryl's mother (2386).

Toilet visits:

Christy - audibly, as Diane and Anthony watch! (2350); Minty - visibly, over Christy's driver's seat (2350); Katrina - reappearing just 28 seconds after she sets off, and flushing after 18 seconds (2354); Jerome (2357); Andrew (2363); Dave (2372 and 2400); Jimmy (2372 and 2384); Mike (2376, three times); Mick (2377); Tim (2391 and 2394); and Victoria (2400). And let's not forget the finest of "Brookside"'s toilet humour, from episode 2368:

Quote:

LEANNE: One of the mens' bogs is blocked.
MIKE: So use the ladies' then.


Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Adele, Anthony and Steve's mother / Jan, Marty's former wife (2356, 2391, 2392 / 2359, 2380, 2388); Robbie and Clint's mother (2365, 2367); Katrina's father (2379, 2391); Frederico, Lance's "other", who lives in Rio de Janeiro (2398): Shelley's younger sister in Bedford (2399); and Amber, a relative of Cheryl (2400).

Goofs:

One of Steve's first lines in episode 2350 becomes unintelligible, as he is torn between "when I've had the time to finish it" and "by the time I've finished with it": "When I've had the time I've finished with it"; and in episode 2352, Tim ends his sixth word with an "s", instead of his fifth: "What happens if she find outs it's us?".

As Ray begins to say "Well, maybe this council stuff'll help you to get started again" about four minutes into episode 2353, a boom microphone can be seen bobbing down above him. He then replaces "after" with "about" in episode 2357 - "Don't you think it'd be a bit embarrassing ABOUT what's happened to Minty?" - and says "Roast lamb is definitely my favourite!" in episode 2358, although he had said that liver and onions was his favourite in episode 2327!

The ticket Rachel looks at in episode 2360 shows a date of 21 April 2000 for the return flight from Alicante to Manchester, which is not consistent with the wedding date of 27th May being only a fortnight away during the hen party week. And, in the same episode, Emily either adds a "with", or replaces "bothering" with "asking", telling Adele, "Don't be asking me with all sorts of stupid questions.".

Jimmy misses the last two letters off "any" in episode 2368: "Do you know someone who's on the lookout for a middle-aged, ex-con scallies, do you?"; and in the same episode, Diane omits her third and fourth words, "want to": "I don't look back over me life when it's too late and think even for one second that I didn't have the guts to try this.".

Two of Katrina's lines in the same scene are messed up in episode 2379. Firstly, "Me dad can't get me to model a job." is probably meant to be something like "Me dad can't take me to my modelling job.". Secondly, her sixth word, "at", is omitted: "And I've got to be a modelling job in half an hour."

Jessie says her husband Tommy has been dead for more than 20 years in episode 2382, but not much more than a year has passed since episode 2196, in which she mentioned that he died ten years ago; and Callum's claim in episode 2389 that he has never been married contradicts dialogue from episodes 1985 and 1987, in which his wife Sheena was mentioned!

Trivia:

The "For Sale" sign in the window of the Murrays' former home, 57 Meadowbank Road (2354, 2379), near the Meadowbank Baths (2354), and next door to Cheryl at number 55 (2379), bears the name "Shannon Estates" and a telephone number beginning 0151 264 56- (2350). Adele, who is reading "Bleak House" by Charles Dickens (2356), used to go to singing lessons (2360), and carries a folder bearing the name "KATE BUSH" (2383), has lived there all her life (2350), but her stepmother Diane has only been there for six years (2357). She is the new manageress of the "New You" Hair and Beauty Salon on the Parade (2353, 2387, 2397), she used to do the hair of the "stars" - including Sonia (2352), and in episode 2351 she is seen reading the note that Lindsey left in episode 2349: "Hope you'll be very happy here. If you need anything, knock next door (no 10). Good luck, Lindsey Corkhill and family". Marty, the caretaker of Brookside Comprehensive (2350, 2351) was present at the birth of Steve (2374), and hires a video from "PIXEL VIDEO" (2384).

According to Steve, Brookside Close is the second turning off Prescot Road (2393). Adele is seen defacing (2350) one of his posters in which "The North West Counties Amateur Boxing Assocation presents a North West Counties ABA Belt Fight - STEVE MURRAY vs ED TURNER". Other boxers involved in bouts in the same event - at Everton Park Sports Centre on Saturday 9th May - are Peter Burdett, Chris Peterson, Toby Drew and Keith Rice (2350, 2351). Christy's employers, named on the van in which he takes the Murrays' furniture to the Close, are E&M WHOLESALE BUTCHERS, and their telephone number is 0151 496 0007 (2350, 2351). The jukebox Anthony looks at in episode 2359 contains records by the Swinging Blue Jeans, Care and the Scaffold, none of whom he has heard of - but musical preferences, mostly of the Murray family, revealed in episodes 2357 and 2358 are the Chemical Brothers (Anthony), Abba (Adele), the Human League (Diane), Genesis - particularly "A Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" (Marty), Bobby Darin (Ray), and Bobby Vinton (Brigid - who has been to "Knock" in episode 2364).

After living with her son Bernard and his unseen wife Jean for nine years, Kitty has spent the last six weeks in "Shady Pines" rest home (2382). She and Bernard have been eating at "The Granary" restaurant (2382), and she was in labour for 18 hours with him (2382) and 36 hours with Ray (2385), who used to have a mongrel (2354). Max is surveying a development in Shore Road (2369), and won a silver medal for boxing from the Lancashire Schoolboys ABA (2383); Barbara lives at number 11 (2372); Ron buys lot 23 in the auction, 8 Brookside Close, for £54,500 (2357); Anthea, who has lived where she is now for 20 years (2394), once lost Megan, who now has a new job in Baltimore (2376) in Paddy's Market (2390); and when he was eight, Tony went missing on the front at Blackpool (2390).

Nisha has been in nursing for eight years, after failing her second-year law exams, and lives in Aigburth (2394). She split up from her boyfriend six months ago (2394), and it emerges in episode 2398 that she was engaged to him, and it was Clint! He is from Parkside (2365), attended "Rodney Bennett", the Catholic school, with Robbie (2366), and their local pub is now the "Swan" (2366). The house in Holland Park at which Jacqueline Teresa Dixon (2376) and Albert Nathan Cuddington (2376) plan to live has eight bedrooms (2375). Charles was the best man at Nathan's first wedding (2376). Their father's horse "Easy Life" wins at Haydock Park (2376) at odds of 6/1 (2377). Mandy and Ruth are unable to come to Rachel's wedding because they have chickenpox (2375). Victoria inherits £30,000 from Mark's mother (2351), and the full name of Leanne's brother is Lance Timothy Powell (2393).

Susannah is reading a Muriel Spark novel (2369); Rachel gets Sinbad a book entitled "Working With Children With Hearing Difficulties" (2370); Sinbad finds the book "The Elves and the Shoemaker" in Jimmy's bedroom (2371); Shelley is seen reading "Wallpaper" magazine (2374); and Anthony reads a book called "Caring For Your Dog" (2378, 2380), and quotes some of the most embarrassing parts from it (2378). A headline in the "Liverpool Echo" seen more than once in episode 2385 is "ANOTHER GANGLAND KILLING - Man Executed", and after reading a newspaper article headed "PHONE BOX SCANDAL OF HIGH CLASS CALL GIRLS", Emily produces cards reading "BUSTY BLONDE AVAILABLE FOR GOOD TIMES, SENSUAL MASSAGE, ESCORT SERVICE. CAN VISIT OFFICES AND HOTELS. CALL 0151 692 6149" (2356). Ron discovers, by ringing it, that this is Susannah's number (2358); and more of the same cards are seen in episodes 2359, 2361, 2362 and 2395.

The art by Richard Diebenkorn which was previously seen in Victoria and Mark's house is now on the wall of her flat (2358, 2360, 2361, 2392), along with art by Mark Rothko (2368, 2369, 2392, 2398). There is still a Britney Spears poster in Emily's bedroom (2383), there is still a Janet Jackson poster in Gemma's bedroom (2393), and there are posters of the "X-Files", the "Blair Witch Project", and one referring to the Valley Stadium, Sheffield, showing a "Ticket Hotline" number 0870 128 2000, on the wall of Tim's garage (2395). The telephone number of Merseytravel - 0151-236 7676 - appears on the bus shelter that becomes Jimmy's home-away-from-home in episode 2363, and there is a logo "MONIKA HOLIDAYS" in the window of the apartment in which the "hens" are staying in Benidorm in episode 2365. Anthony (2353), Jackie (2354), WPC Trainor (2354), Rachel (2357), Mick (2372, 2378), Sinbad (2372, 2400), Shelley (2374, 2387), Susannah (2378), Ron (2378, 2380), Dave (2378, 2381, 2392), Kitty (2382), Andrew (2388), Josh (2390), Max (2394), Christine (2395) and William (2400) are all right-handed, whereas Duane (2367), Bev (2393) and Diane (2396) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Towards the end of episode 2350, the outright winner of the "this really must have seemed like a good idea at the time" award must surely be the "materialisation" of the entire Murray family from nowhere into a virtually empty room of the home they are shortly going to leave, which is strangely reminiscent of the way that aliens might transport themselves from one location to another in a science-fiction television series or movie.......

Bev's words in the original broadcast of episode 2352, "If I'd have known you were a rug-muncher I'd have never agreed to you getting the job.", are changed in the Saturday teatime omnibus repeat, in which a different recording of the same scene is used: "If I'd have known you were a lesbian I'd have never agreed to you getting the job.".

At the beginning of episode 2359, the same song - "A Heart As Big As My Home Town" by Pete Wylie - is being listened to on the radio by three different households.

Cousin Jill's surname is not revealed in episode 2376 - but it is strongly implied that the performer Jane Rossington is playing the same character that she portrayed in Midlands-based soap opera "Crossroads" for many years! Before she appears, there is this clue:

Quote:

HILARY: You should see cousin Jill's home. Makes me feel positively like a council tenant.
RON: Oh yeah? And, er, where did she get her money from, then?
HILARY: She started very modestly with a motel in the Midlands, invested wisely, and hey presto.......


And, later, when she makes her fleeting appearance, this is what happens:

Quote:

CHARLES: Jill! Long time no see.
JILL: Charles! [they kiss]
CHARLES: Oh, let me introduce Beverley.
BEV: Hi, queen.
CHARLES: There we are, Jill - treated like royalty at last.
JILL: I wish I had her money.
BEV: I believe you're in the hospitality trade, Jill. We'll have to have a good chin-wag.
DEBORAH: Beverley, did that waiter find you?
BEV: No.
DEBORAH: There's a phone call in the drawing room.
BEV: What, for me?
DEBORAH: Someone called.......Leanne, was it? Apparently your bar is on fire.
BEV: You're joking!
JILL: Oh, how dreadful. I remember when the motel went up in smoke.......


Episode 2378 begins with an old gag best known for its appearance in the first episode of "Porridge", although it had previously been heard in "Love Thy Neighbour" - as Marty reads in bed, and Diane comes into the bedroom with a specimen bottle:

Quote:

DIANE: Right, lover boy - I want this fillin' today.
MARTY: What, from here?


In episode 2380, while Jacqui and Victoria are discussing whether they would be better off with or without Nathan and Darren respectively, the song "Better The Devil You Know" is playing on their radio.......and, just as Ray and Jessie begin to become intimate in his caravan in episode 2382, the scene changes to a close-up of one of Ray's wind-ornaments outside, driven into action by a sudden gust - a woodcutter with an axe begins to frantically and repeatedly chop his wood.......

In episode 2391 a photograph of Anthony as a baby held by his mother, Jan, is briefly seen on-screen a couple of times - and, although Jan is not destined to make a physical appearance for another two years yet, it is a performer who actually looks not dissimilar to the woman in the photograph that would eventually be cast in that role!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

The 2,400th episode of "Brookside" ends with something happening that's we've already seen quite a few times before.......a projectile comes flying through the Corkhills' window! Although this seems to confirm Sinbad's fears that there may be worse trouble to come if he stays at number 10, Jackie insists, and Jimmy takes a moment out of his dish-wiping to agree, that he is not leaving - he is like one of the family, and she wouldn't let any one of her family be treated the way he has been. She goes to the door, and looks around the Close, but there is no sign now of the brick-thrower - Leanne.
