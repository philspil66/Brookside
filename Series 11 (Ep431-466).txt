The full cast and production credits in episodes 433 and 434 are followed by an alphabetical list of names covering the whole year's team. These roll over the usual image of the Close until near the end, when there is a fade to another view of the Close, from which many of those listed are seen waving. The closing music lasts for approximately 2 minutes in each of these episodes.

The caption at the beginning of part two of episode 454 reads "End of Part Two".

Making her "Brookside" debut is Bernadette Foley, in the role of musician Fran Pearson - several years later she would rejoin the cast as Margi Shadwick (nee Benson).

The storylines:

Bobby has a major health and safety issue to deal with at work, and a holiday in Rome with Sheila. Damon dumps Gail and woos Debbie, and Karen leaves the Close. Harry eventually proves that Ralph's friend Madge is just a gold-digger, and Paul looks after a puppy, until Gordon accidentally kills her. More short-term lodgers join and leave Pat and Terry, while the Corkhills continue to battle with their financial problems. And an engaged professional couple buy Heather's house, looking forward to a happy life together on the Close........but are they right to be optimistic?

The dates:

It is Monday 22nd December in episode 433, and 30th December 1986 in episode 436. In episode 438 it is "just after Christmas", in episode 440 and it is eight months since Harry and Ralph were in Torquay, and in episode 441 mid-August is "a long way away". It is Valentine's Day and February in episode 447, and Monday afternoon in episode 451. It is 1987 in episode 452, and Saturday in episode 454, when the sale starts at 2 pm. The Mersey Marathon is nine months away in episode 455. It is Saturday in episode 457, and Sunday in episodes 458 and 461, which is also Mother's Day. Mr Howman's calendar shows "23 MARCH" in episode 459, and when telephoning the travel agent in episode 464, Bobby says the flight to Rome is on 13th April.

Name-checks:

Sherlock Holmes (433); Billy Smart (434); Venezia Perrugio (434); Tears For Fears (436); Simple Minds (436); "Give Us A Clue" (437); Cyril Smith (440); "Dixon Of Dock Green" (441); "Wonder Woman" (444); Barbara Cartland (446); Red Robbo of British Leyland (447); Samantha Fox (448 ); Bette Davis (449); Philip Marlow (451); Derek Hatton (452); Jim Peters, runner (454); Jim Fixx (455); Paul McCartney (455); Bob Geldof (455); "Mastermind" (459); and the Eurovision Song Contest (459).


Locations:

While most of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, some is set in Tunbridge Wells and Rome. There are brief scenes set in Tunbridge of Billy telephoning Doreen in the rain, very close to a road sign referring to Maidstone, Tunbridge, Penshurst and Sevenoaks in lettering similar to that which would appear on a real one, in episode 454; and in his caravan, seen in a field, in episode 456 - although these were not necessarily filmed there. There are, however, many scenes involving Billy, Doreen and others in Tunbridge Wells in episodes 457 and 458, and even more scenes of Bobby and Sheila in Rome throughout episodes 465 and 466.

Births:

There is a vast amount of birthday talk in this season. In episode 437 it is observed that in 2000 Damon will be 32, Barry will be over 40, Sheila will be 59, Bobby will be over 60, Karen will be 34 and Claire, whose 2nd birthday is tomorrow, will be 15; and Madge says her birthday is tomorrow. It is Claire's birthday - if not Madge's! - in episode 438, and it is revealed in episode 439 that she is now 2, and her date of birth is 6th January. In episode 439 Harry is already sure that Madge was born the same day that he started work - July 30th 1938. He makes Ralph remember more birthdays in episode 440 - Grace's was 6th April, Ralph's mum's was 19th October, Ralph's dad's was 11th June, and Harry's is 7th August, while Madge's are still 6th January and 30th July. Harry finally proves that Madge's true birthday is 30th July by studying her driving licence in episode 448. In episode 455, Harry observes that Edna would have been 66 next week, and Annabelle reminds Paul that he was in his early 20's in 1946. We are also told that Rod is 18 (435), Tracy is 16 (454, 461), Doreen is nearly 40 (437), Debbie is 16 (465), and it is Bobby's birthday in episode 461.

Marriages:

None. Doreen and Billy will have been married for 20 years "this summer" (444), and Bobby and Sheila have now been married for 28 years, according to Sheila (461), or 30 years, according to Bobby (461, 462, 465, 466).

Deaths:

Two - Paul's dog Lucky is run over and killed by Gordon in episode 455, and, after Damon takes a telephone message that someone has died of asbestosis in episode 465, Bobby reveals in episode 466 that it is Don Atkinson. We are also told thet the following are dead: Julia's husband, Albert (438 ); Martin's uncle, a worker at Billinge's, who died last week of cancer of the lining of the lung (439); and Ralph's mother and father (440). Madge mentions that Tony Cagliorani (449, 452) died during the war on 30th July (449), and her husband Frank died nine years ago (451, 452). This may or may not be the same husband as the previously mentioned Desmond.......but Madge is a con-artist anyway!


Toilet visits:

Charlie (431); Terry (449); Billy (462); and, most memorably, Jamie - who finds that there is no toilet paper! (466)
