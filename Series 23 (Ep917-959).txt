"Meadowcroft Park" is mentioned again in episodes 932, when we are told it is on on Mondays, and 943. Television images of the series, including an "End of part one" caption, are seen, and some characters' voices are heard, in episode 951, in which Max is watching it (without understanding why); and further voices are heard in episode 955, in which Jimmy is watching it, and DD says she thinks it is shown on a different day in Wales.

Goofs:

While referring to his father in episode 925, Max says "he lived...." rather than "he's lived....", which may give the mistaken impression that his father is no longer alive, even though his continued existence is confirmed at other times both earlier and later in the series.

Mike adds an extra syllable in episode 926: "A shop in the offERing".

Having told Chrissy he has lived where he is now for about two years in episode 922, Tim claims in episode 938 that he has lived there for about four years. [Perhaps a few weeks of living with Sammy has seemed more like two years!!]

Bumper misses out the middle word, "do", in episode 940: "I like seeing him what he does best".

The radio broadcast heard in the background in episode 943 is the same one that Billy was seen listening to in episode 502, which refers to the robbery of supermarket manager Riordan!

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

Susan refers to her employers as "Smith Filed and Mullaney" in episode 934, whereas everyone else in this and other episodes calls them "Smiths Foulds and Mulvaney". As it later emerges that she is actually an actress on a head-hunting exercise, it would appear that she is deliberately giving Patricia a clue that all is not as it seems. Patricia doesn't ever point out the discrepancy, but becomes more suspicious of Susan, and of the whole situation, after this conversation!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As they prepare for their race, Sinnott suggests that the winner should be the one whose car goes through a narrow gap first. Jacqui unsuccessfully tries to persuade Mike that he should withdraw, as Sinnott is trying to kill him. The race begins, and Jacqui can only watch as the cars build up speed, and crash.......
