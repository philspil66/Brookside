From episode 2101 onwards, a new titles sequence - the eighth - is used, which is very similar to the seventh. The main difference is that a young lady can now be seen walking through the garage from two angles (and at two speeds!) instead of a young man.

Episode 2106 includes a flashback of images originally seen in episode 2105; Mandy and Beth are seen only in a brief flashback from an earlier episode in episode 2131; and Little Jimmy is only seen in flashbacks from earlier episodes in episode 2133 and "Friday The Thirteenth".

"The Magic Rabbits" and "Meadowcroft Park" are both seen again in episode 2135, watched by Tim. During the latter, he is joined by Matt.

The original broadcasts of episodes 2127 to 2136 each had a selection of extracts from the following episode edited in - generally quite messily - after the conclusion of the action and before the closing titles sequence, accompanied by either a voice-over or a caption. However, the last five of these episodes were each repeated in a lunchtime slot on the first weekday after their original broadcast, but without these unnecessary previews! Episode 2137 was then the last to receive a quick additional airing, on Monday 16th November 1998.

Robert Wheelan's appearance as the auctioneer in episode 2129 adds him to a very short list of perfomers credited in four different minor "Brookside" roles.

The storylines:

Tim is persuaded to stop trying to kill Sinbad, and moves back in with him, only to fear for his own life when they are briefly joined by the eccentric Mr Moore. An ideal replacement tenant, Alec, is soon found - but unfortunately his relatives by marriage, the Musgroves, are not far behind....... Ollie leaves the Close with Danny, after Louise goes back to her foster parents, and Eleanor walks out on him after betraying him with, but ensuring that he is cleared of blame for the death of, Marcus. Bruno's hopes for a relationship with Rachel are dashed, as he is redeployed elsewhere - although Mike, reinstated at "Bar Brookie", may be about to follow in his footsteps; and Ron sets up a new business, "Great Grannies", taking on as office manager, an old - and possibly new - flame, Anthea. Jacqui gives birth to surrogate baby Harry, but finds it harder to give him up to Max and Susannah than she anticipated - and then she discovers that Max is having an affair! He soon joins both Mick and Jason in discovering that seeing two women at the same time probably isn't a good idea, while Greg and Margi are more impressed with Emily's capacity for running than Nikki's capacity for drinking. And Jimmy begins teaching, but is soon suspended when he tries to help a pupil who is taking drugs, giving him time to pursue the killer of Little Jimmy; while Lindsey prepares to marry Peter, divorcing Gary and convincing him to disappear from her life forever. But can this Corkhill wedding really be the first one to go entirely according to plan?

The dates:

It is Tuesday in episode 2095; and, based on dialogue in episode 2098 and 2101, it is Tuesday in episode 2102. It is a Sunday in August in episode 2100, and it is Bank Holiday Monday in episode 2101. It is September in episode 2103, and it is the National Year of Reading in episode 2112. Based on dialogue in episode 2124, it is Friday in episode 2126, in which a 1998 calendar can be seen on the wall of Katie's office; and an auction sign indicates that it is Friday 30th October in episode 2129. Based on dialogue in episodes 2130 and 2131, it is Thursday in episode 2131 and Friday in episode 2132; and, based on earlier dialogue and one of the last lines spoken in the latter, it is Friday 13th in both episode 2137 and "Friday The Thirteenth".

Locations:

There are scenes in Chester in episodes 2090, 2092, 2094, 2096, 2097, 2098, 2105, 2106, 2107 and 2108 - but only those in episode 2097 were definitely recorded there, as the others are merely set in a hospital (2106, 2107 and 2108) and/or in Lisa's flat (all except 2108). Episode 2104 takes place entirely in the Lake District, as do some scenes in episodes 2101, 2103, 2105, 2106; parts of episodes 2107 and 2119 are set in Keswick, albeit not recognisably so; and the rest of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool.

Births:

One - Harry Farnham is born to Jacqui and Max in episode 2108, having been due "next week" in episode 2105. It is five months until Susannah is due to give birth in episode 2098, and she is five months pregnant in episodes 2117 and 2123 / nearly six months pregnant in episode 2127. Rose is also pregnant in episode 2129.

It was Alice's birthday yesterday in episode 2197; it is Eleanor's birthday in episode 2109; it is Kylie's sixth birthday in episode 2110, although she is having her party "the day before" in episode 2108; it is the 17th birthday of Leo, "nearly 18" in episode 2102, in episode 2113, after being "tomorrow" in episode 2111; and in episode 2135 Max claims that he is organising a celebration of Warren's 40th birthday.

Nikki is 18 (2090, 2096, 2098); Little Jimmy was born 25 years ago (2092); William is 13 months old (2092); Tim is nearly 18 (2093); Eleanor is 18 years older than Louise (2101); Ron is 10 years older than Mick (2116); Danny is nearly 17 (2116, 2117) / 17 (2122); Andrea is 22 (2110, 2118); Emily is 15 (2126); Mike is four years older than Rachel (2126); Lindsey is 26 (2128); Susan is 14 (2128); and Justin is six or seven years older than Susan, according to Jimmy (2128).

Eleanor's date of birth, according to a document seen in episode 2115, is "Sept 1960"; and Little Jimmy's gravestone, indicating that he was born on 26th March 1974, is seen again in episode 2135.


Marriages:

None. Lindsey's application for her divorce, dated 26th August 1998, and declaring that she and Gary were married at St Christopher's Church, Manor Park, Liverpool on 21st June 1991, is seen in episodes 2102 and 2105, and she receives notification of her divorce, dated 14 October 1998, in episode 2123. She and Peter plan to marry on 14th November (2110, 2123, 2125) / on the "14th", which is "a month away" (2121). However, in episode 2125 they bring the date forward by a day, to Friday the 13th (2125, 2127, 2128, 2132, FTT), which is two weeks on Friday (2128) / "tomorrow" (2136). We are also told that Julia is marrying a retired flying doctor she has met in Australia (2117), to which she has travelled for Tracy's wedding (2114, 2117), at which Sheila, Billy, Rod and Doreen were all guests (FTT).

Deaths:

One - Marcus Seddon falls from a cliff in episode 2105. Rufus Carmichael also dies after being hit by a huge flying boulder, then squashed under falling, flammable, industrial oil drums - but only in "Friday The Thirteenth". The following unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters who are also mentioned are: Mrs Rotherham, the Legion's cleaner for years, found dead in the ladies' loo in episode 2106; Lindsey's uncle, Jimmy's brother Franky (2108, 2126, 2133, 2134, 2135); Mick's mother and father (2110); Jimmy's mother (2113); Max's father's uncle Harry (2113); Billy Baxter, a former mate of Ron with whom he once fought in the playground (2114); Anthea's husband, who died four years ago (2117); Mr Moore's unnamed wife (2129); and Alec's wife Helen, who died 30 years ago of cancer (2133). Little Jimmy's gravestone, indicating that he died on 29th November 1996, is seen again in episode 2135, in which Jimmy observes that it is "over a year" since he died.

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Mike Dillon, a "spark" that Greg knows (2090); Bruno's mother (2090); Sandra, Pauline's friend (2091); Serena, Gemma's friend (2091); Sian's mother, father and little stupid brother (2092); Ginette, health club receptionist (2093); Sandra at Colin's office (2093); Derek, Rose's first boyfriend (2093); Tom McGann, Ollie's boss (2095); Errol, a possibly fictitious old boyfriend of Pauline (2095); Mrs Herbert, a client of Eleanor, and Judge Pennington, before whom she is appearing (2098); Tim's aunt, his mother's sister (2098, 2099) / his aunt Angie (2105); Bryn Williams, another client of Eleanor (2099); Eleanor's father (2099); Mark's family (2100); Andrea's "nan", who is in a nursing home (2100); Laura, a mate of Andrea (2100); Les, a customer of Ron (2106, 2107); Mr Matthews, a customer of Ron (2106, 2107); Mr Beswick, head of Science at Brookside Comprehensive (2107); Souter and Harris, potential troublemakers in Jimmy's history class (2107); Tyrone, a mate of Leo (2110); Katie Campbell, a girl the same age as Leo (2113); Max's father (2113, 2115); Joey McFadden, an old friend of Ron and Anthea (2116); Samantha, who Leo says he met on his birthday (2117); Alison, a salon worker (2118); Ricky, who Rachel met on holiday (2120); Matt Kadero, a student (2120); Mr Cooper, whose year 8 class includes Susan (2123); Joey, a mate of Greg (2123); Steven, a contact of Margi at "Farmfresh" (2124); Miss Thomas, another of Susan's teachers (2124); "Letchy" Leach, Jackie's old P.E. teacher (2124); Cliff, Mrs Chalmers' husband (2125); Justine and Virginia, salon employees (2125); Madame Ricard, Emily's French teacher (2126); Sandra, a friend of Jackie, who loaned Jackie her wedding dress (2127); Mark, whose stag night Jason claims to be going to (2127); Mrs Brown, whose water tank Jason claims is leaking (2127); Mrs Matthews, a salon customer (2128); Susan's parents (2128); Gozz, another mate of Greg (2128); Mrs Kelly, who is due in for a perm (2130); Ellie, Luke's ex-girlfriend with whom he used to live (2136, 2137); Bosko's nan (2137); and Peter's mother (FTT).

Goofs:

Mike seems to omit the first three words "He looks like" in episode 2120: "He's doing all right to me"; and in the same episode, Jimmy claims that Susan Clarke is in "Year Three", whereas it is later made clear that she is actually in "Year Eight".

In episode 2124, after Susannah tells him she is going to the doctor to see if everything is all right, Max sounds as if he is asking two questions instead of one: "Why?.......Shouldn't it be?".

Sinbad omits his second "as" after "serious" in episode 2131: "You can't have something as serious that happen to you and expect to keep it to yourself.".

Jimmy refers to Rufus as "the fella that I haven't seen since the day our Jimmy was killed" in episode 2133, and makes similar observations in later episodes too. But he DIDN'T see him then!

Trivia:

A "Brookside Comprehensive" sign seen in episodes 2097 and 2126 lists the headmaster as "Mr C. Thornton B.Ed (Hons)" [ so his previously revealed forename, "Dick", may be more of a nickname (possibly an appropriate one!) ], the caretaker as Mr D. Saunders, and the telephone number as 0151 269 3223. Having previously been in the RAF, Roger has taught there for six years (2124), and Karen has taught for 16 years (2092). Among the school's 762 pupils (2129) is Susan Clarke, an only child (2126) in year 8 (2123, 2129), which is the same year as Emily, and two years below Leo (2121), who gets a "B" in his Maths GCSE, a "C" in history, an "E" in Food Tech, and "D" in all the others (2099), and has never been to London (2112). Danny, who is seen looking at "The Space Exploration Website" (2111), gets four "A"s and three "B"s in his GCSEs (2100). In her "A" levels, Nikki gets two "B"s, a "C" and a "D" (2097), and the course she begins at University is called "Life, Literature and Thought" (2120) - but she soon switches to "Applied Psychology" (2126).

The first time Marcus and Eleanor made love was on the moors north of Newcastle (2095). He then went to prison for 18 years (2104, 2105, 2119), which included three years in a secure psychiatric unit (2114); and the dedication in his book, "A Love Affair Interrupted" (2093, 2097) reads "This book is dedicated to Eleanor and Louise - A Love Affair Continued" (2090, 2097). A "Record Of Interview" seen briefly on-screen in episode 2115 reveals that Eleanor was interviewed by D.C.I. Hallam, with P.C. Croft also present, at Cumbria Constabulary, Stanah Lane, Keswick, CA12 4RS, on 8th September 1998. A letter addressed to "Ms. L. Hope, 9 Brookside Close, Manor Park, Liverpool L43 6TZ" from "HM Coroner for Cumbria, Stanah House, 16-18 Meridian Lane, Keswick CA17 4RT" is also briefly seen in episode 2120. Eleanor's clients are taken over by Nathan Cuddington of Levy, Brown, Saundersen and Co. (2125, 2129), who is married (2125). His office number in town is 781 2945 (2129).

Ron's advertisement for "Great Grannies", seen in episode 2090, reads as follows:

"Great Grannies" Agency - There when you need them! Is it always a race to pick up the kids from school? Is facing a mountain of ironing the last thing you want to do after a hard day at the office? Is a relaxing weekend what you had in mind, rather than battling that garden of weeds? "Great Grannies" could be the answer to all your problems. Our mature and responsible team provides a full domestic support service to meet any requirements. So ring "Great Grannies".......

Anthea is from Kirkdale (2123), and was the first girl Ron even kissed, when they were about nine years old (2114). She and Ron went to St Wilfred's school, and later worked at the same Birds' Eye factory (2116). It emerges somewhat belatedly that Sinbad is paying off his recent fine at a similarly slow rate as Ron - it episode 2127 he mentions that he has to pay £60 per month. In the same episode, he decides to rent out a room for £75 per week, and receives a cheque from Mr Moore for two months in advance - £600 (2127, 2128).

Greg's customers include Marshall's (2128), persuaded to pay their bill by Margi, whose union work involves "Kimmin's Cakes" (2093) and "FarmFresh" (2100, 2124). Colin, one of her colleagues, was at the LSE "for three weeks" (2093). Rufus owns a pet shop - "R.J.'s Pet Bazaar" (2135) on the corner of Probert Street (2134, 2136), and the former address of Joey - a milkman (2135, 2137) who drives "Goldline" taxi number 1223 (2137) - is 47 Dunghill Lane (2135). Alec used to be a postman, and now works for a delivery firm (2133); Niamh works at EasyLec on Princess Drive (2136); and Ollie recalls that Bel used to work at "Niven's" (2101). Rachel plans to go to a gig at which the act "Glimmer" are playing (2128); and Pauline gives Mick, who has been shopping at Tesco's (2094), a "Curtis Mayfield's Greatest Hits" CD (2090).

Jimmy, who finds Susan left for dead in Cromdale Road (2132), and has never been on a plane (2114), adopts the alias "Sergeant Dickinson of the West Lancashire Constabulary" (FTT). Other commitments on the same day of the vicar who is to marry Lindsey and Peter are the South Preston Morris Dancing Knock-out Cup Quarter-Finals, and a post-match celebration at the "Ring O' Bells" pub (FTT). According to Susannah, who had two false alarms with Matthew, and was in labour with him for ten hours (2106), "Grants" has a staff of fifteen (2123). She has known Faye, who has no children (2132) for at least 15 years (2137), and discovers that Max has been having an affair with her for nearly 20 years, ever since they were at college (2137).

The "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's" and the telephone number 0151 629 1676 is still outside the Farnhams' in episodes 2091, 2092 and 2099; and other signs bearing this name and number, but in a new corporate image, are seen outside Sinbad's former shop (2124), at the Simpsons' (2128, 2129, 2134, 2136, 2137) and at the auction of 98 properties, including Lot 58 - St Christopher's Church Hall, which is bought for £70,000 by Jacqui (2129). The telephone number 0151 269 5941 is seen again on Greg's van in episodes 2097, 2110 and 2116; a taxi used by the holidaymakers in the Lake District bears the telephone number 814635 in episode 2103; Macca's van bears the out-of-date telephone number 051-226-7212 and a business name beginning "West Derby Glass &" in episode 2121; and one of the lorries seen on the Close in episode 2137 is from "Cheshire Roof Trusses".

Art by Ansel Adams (2096, 2097, 2098, 2099, 2125, 2129) and Claude Monet (2090, 2096, 2099) is seen again in Eleanor's office; art by Robert Delaunay can be seen on the Farnhams' wall in episodes 2127 and 2128; and art by Colin Crane, Year 11, can be seen on a school wall in episode 2129! Eleanor (2090, 2096), Kylie (2098), Peter (2110), Lindsey (2110, 2123), Ron (2114, 2115), Jacqui (2116), the coroner (2119), Max (2124), Mr Moore (2127), and Katie (2129) are all right-handed, while Jimmy is left-handed (2098, 2105, 2107, 2112, 2121).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

For one brief moment in episode 2097, Max calls his future wife "Jacq" instead of "Jacqui".

The "guest publication" in episode 2098 is "TILES" magazine, which Ollie is seen flicking through; and we also see, in the same episode, that he has brought home from his trip a copy of "Tring - A Pictorial History". His evenings in must just fly by.......

The following words from a longer conversation between Sinbad and Jimmy in episode 2130 sound inconsequential, but would later be heard many, many more times as a generic Channel Four introduction to "Brookside", often replacing a more specific announcement just before the start of a new episode:

Quote:

SINBAD: You're the one who's in trouble now. You know the score.

JIMMY: I didn't think it would turn out like this, though, did I?

SINBAD: That's the trouble, Jimmy - you never do think. What's Jackie had to say about it all?

JIMMY: I haven't told her yet.

Sinbad's reaction to the arrival of a somewhat old, battered, multicoloured wedding car for Lindsey in "Friday The Thirteenth" cannot be heard, but lip-readers should be able to tell that it is "What the f---?".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Episode 2137 ends with Lindsey telling Jackie and Jimmy that she won't go to her wedding - she isn't marrying Peter. However, "Friday The Thirteenth" - which viewers unfortunately need to have watched before the next season begins, in order to avoid a certain amount of confusion - ends with her arriving at the church with Jimmy, after a somewhat eventful journey there!
