The storylines:

In this short season, Terry's plans to expand his business empire, with Jacqui and JC as investors, lead to the discovery of a dead body and the return of his long-lost father - events that are not absolutely unconnected. Georgia and Nat desperately want to remain connected, despite resistance from their parents, a suicide attempt by Jules, the threat of police charges, and even a possible pregnancy. Meanwhile, Susannah ousts David to take charge of "Grants" and employs Julia as her housekeeper, Bel gets a job at the "Trading Post", and Sinbad and Val abandon their plans to marry, but Mick begins to get to know his future wife, Elaine! And, when Ron's long-lasting relationship with Bev runs into real difficulties, just as Jimmy's marriage breaks down again as his desperate attempts to rehabilitate Little Jimmy finally come to nothing, he has high hopes for a better future with Jackie. After all, haven't they always got on like a house on fire.......?

Trivia:

Jackie's favourite subject at school was Art (1801). She was 16 when she first met Jimmy (1815), who spent time in Walton jail (1820), and whose voluntary work is for the "Straight 8 Project, Information and Counselling Service" (1797). It is more than 13 years ago that he was caught with Val by Little Jimmy (1811), and the telephone number of Chris Harty, who Andy advises him to call, is 775 2617 (1797). Kylie's favourite doll is called Blodwyn (1811).

Nat consults a book, "Genetics and Family Biology" (1825). Jules's address, at which Danny sends her roses allegedly from Nat, is Mallam House, Churchill Quay (1802). Her apartment number is 86 (1805). The branch of Elton's bookshop at which Ollie works is "just down from Lord Street" (1821). Bel used to work for "Niven's" (1796, 1805, 1806), at which Bev and Ron bought their four-poster bed (1806). According to Ron, Bev reads "Cosmo" (1810). The book Mike has written is called "The Fear Within" (1809). Tom is an accountant with the Diocese, and compere at St Mary's Catholic Club (1822).

Susannah and Max's old house was in Fornby (1818). Susannah has committed Matthew and Emily to a year at King's Elm Grammar School (1806), and has been shopping at John Lewis (1819). David spent some time in Aden with the army medical corps (1798). Henry Fraser, last seen alive down at the "Red Lion" pub, is to be buried at St Peter's (1823), and his sister Stella is from Childwall (1817). Julia claims that the last time she won a raffle was in 1948 (1824).

The letterhead of the "Contract of Sale of Ownership", which Susannah has already signed and dated 11/12/96, and which David signs in episode 1821, is from "Meale, Manton & Co, Solicitors", of 14A North Bank Road, Southport, Lancashire PS17 0QT - Tel./Fax 01704 951674, Telex 452290 Southport. It is dated 3rd December 1996, and shows the postcode of Brookside Close as L43 6TZ. There are typos in the first line ("between" is omitted) and in the address ("Park" is shown as "park")!

The "For Sale" sign erected outside number 10 in episode 1822, which is still there in episode 1823, bears the estate agents' name "Haskayne Brimstage" and the telephone number 0151 269 4000. Jimmy's skip bears the telephone number 051 489 1522 (1823). He is left-handed (1797), and so is Mr Thornton (1810); while Sinbad (1798), Mick (1799), Susannah (1810, 1821), Max (1811, 1812, 1819, 1821), David (1821), Lindsey (1823), and Georgia (1824) are all right-handed.

A sign is erected on the parade in episode 1800 giving full details of JC's company: "J.C. Bradley (Construction) Ltd, Domestic, Commercial and Industrial Specialists, 0151 692 3109". This is seen again in episodes 1812, 1817, 1823 and 1824, and fleetingly on a van driving past in episode 1802; and other signs, showing just the company name, can be seen in episodes 1818, 1820 and 1822. A "Fletchers" sign can be seen again in the distance in episodes 1819 and 1823; and a newspaper extract headed "Manor Park mystery body id[entified]" seen briefly on-screen in episode 1818 starts off well, but soon turns into something else:

"HENRY FRASER has been named as the mystery body found during building work under La Luz nightclub, Manor Park. Fraser, a 25-year-old sailor from West Derby, went missing in 1966 It was the third such tragedy on Merseyside in 18 months. Anthony is thought to have touched the 750 volt third.......which powers the trains. His father, electrician .......Lewis, from the Aintree ........., told the ECHO "Anthony.......a lovely lad. We are absolutely devastated. We only recently allowed him to go playing ......... further. He had always been ....... not to go near the ....... line. "

Further cuttings, including one headed "LOCAL MAN MISSING", are also seen, but luckily not quite as close-up, in episode 1819.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

From the moment at which Julia enters the employ of, and should therefore show respect to, Max and Susannah Farnham, she pronounces their surname as if it is double-barrelled.......except for one occasion in episode 1825, when she forgets and reverts to "Farnham" instead of "Farn-Ham"!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having left Jackie watching a late film downstairs, Ron's attempts to get to sleep are disturbed by Kylie crying. He gets up out of bed, opens his bedroom door, finds that the landing is full of smoke and the staircase is ablaze, and frantically calls out to Mike and Lindsey that the house is on fire.......
