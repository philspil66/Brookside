Goofs:

In court in episode 1045, Danny's full name is given as "Daniel Terrence Sullivan", whereas it has previously been "Daniel John Sullivan".

In episode 1050 Max may be confused, but viewers are almost certainly baffled, as Patricia is apparently supposed to have "at least another three weeks' convalescence"...."until the end of next month".

Katie's second, third and fourth words are in the wrong order in episode 1051: "I already thought you had a boyfriend?". Later in the same episode, when saying goodbye to Mick, Ron calls him "Mike".

Leanne forgets that the deputy head is married in episode 1056: "That Miss Harrison....".

Trivia:

The registrar's signature on Sinbad's birth certificate looks like "Ricky E Coombe", the registration date is 15th February 1957, and the address of his parents is given as 41 Geraghty Street (1044). While Sinbad confirms that it names his mother as Olive Norah Sweeney (1046), it later emerges that she is his grandmother, and Ruth is his mother (1052). His weight when he was born on 26th January 1957 was 8 lb 3 oz (1059). Never previously mentioned, his surname, "Sweeney", is revealed in episode 1044, the first name "Tommy" follows in episode 1049, and the full ensemble, "Thomas Henry Edward" arrives in episode 1050. Ruth, who lives in Runcorn (1049, 1050) at number 41 (1049, 1054), gave up sugar about ten years ago, and doesn't smoke (1056). She has a dog (1052), and works in a library (1054), where she is seen putting a book by David Niven back on the shelf (1055). Her father was a church warden at St Michael's, and worked in the town clerks' department (1055).

Rod doesn't smoke (1063). Jackie is right-handed (1064), and worked in a paper shop in 1971 (1052). On her second date with Jimmy he gave her a record - "Never Ending Song Of Love" by the New Seekers (1052). Barry is left-handed (1052). The Lambert girls' toys include "Dolly Mary" (1045). Fran and Sue worked at Ackroyd, Bryson and Tremayne (1047). Jacqui, who is to take her GCSEs in a few months (1073), has two baths a day (1068). Derek decided to be a priest when he was 12 (1043). The "For Sale" sign with the name "Binenan Estates" and the telephone number 051 259 9106 is still outside the bungalow (1039). Patricia's favourite flowers are freesias (1047). Claire makes car seat covers (1054). Mick went to catering college (1072). Gemma's classmates include William Adams, Stephen Benbow, Elaine Boundy, Linda Davey, Liz Hanna, Dave Jones, Paul Michaels and Michael Neary (1079).

Barbara previously worked at Fairfield Comprehensive in rural Lincolnshire (1074). John refers to a book called "Ribbons and Medals" by H. Taprell Dorning (1048). He won a microwave cooker seven years ago (1056), and a pocket calculator and vegetable steamer this year (1064). The company he ran with his brother Hugh, of which Barbara was also a director (1062), makes brass pins for plugs (1042). The Harrisons have no grandchildren (1041). Peter, their only son (1060), sat his final exams two years ago (1041), gaining a degree in Chemistry at Oxford (1060). Frank, who has always liked rice pudding (1066), met Chrissy in 1970, a week after Dave Edmunds was at number 1 with "I Hear You Knocking" (1075). Grace's grandmother has told Mrs Daniels that Grace is now engaged (1073). Owen is right-handed (1067), and Leanne is left-handed (1063). Terry has never been to Cardiff (1065).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

Julia might not be quite as honest in some respects as she claims to be in others while addressing the audience at the Legion in episode 1049: "Sacking an innocent woman who hasn't stolen a carrot in the whole of her sixt....fifty odd years she's been alive." Based on the only previous revelation of her age (in episode 314), she is actually 69 now!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Barry's pursuit of the Hamouds' van is halted by several youths, including Darren, running away from the burning primary school and across the road in front of his jeep. Hearing noises from within the building, he guesses that there is still someone trapped inside, breaks the door down, recognises that it is Jacqui, and does his best to revive and rescue her.......
