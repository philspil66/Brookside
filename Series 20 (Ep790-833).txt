The storylines:

This is a time of change for "Brookside", as the series goes thrice-weekly, yet there will be little or no opportunity after this season to see again the Collins family, Harry Cross, or the Chois. While Jonathan moves back in with Terry, Sue moves out after her secret is revealed; Mick's wife Josie and his children arrive to join him; and there are some early glimpses of the next family that will be coming to live on the Close.......the Farnhams!

Elsewhere, Frank parts company with the co-operative, and loses another job due to his references, resulting in money problems for the Rogers family; Tracy becomes pregnant, has an abortion, witnesses a suicide, and is one of a few guests not provided with a dinner suit for the wedding of Bobby and Sheila. However, the release from prison of the killer of Jimmy and Billy's older brother leads to a series of violent confrontations. Will the last of these result in Sheila becoming a widow?


The dates:

It is Monday in episode 790 (wholly set in the late evening / night) and, based on dialogue in episode 786, 14th May 1990; and it is a bank holiday in episode 794. It is June 1990 in episodes 802 and 803, and, based on dialogue in episode 802, it is Wednesday in episode 803. It is the middle of summer in episode 804, and the 90's in episode 818. Based on dialogue in episode 819, it is Friday in episode 818, when the wreath is delivered; and based on dialogue in episode 814, it is Friday 10th August in episodes 820 and 821. There has been a (football) World Cup this year (822), and it is summer (824). Frank's new job is meant to start on Tuesday 28th August 1990 (827). As it is Saturday and a bank holiday weekend in episode 828, and the job is now due to start "on Tuesday", this must be Saturday 25th August 1990. It is Friday in episode 830.

Goofs:

In episode 792, Liam refers to the "Empire StateS Building".

Paul has forgotten that the dog he briefly looked after was female in episode 793: "Not very lucky, was he?"; and in episode 797 he tells Lucy that "Your mother and I are very fond of Judith". But when could Annabelle ever have met her?

According to Billy, when speaking to Kathy in episode 798, "You're not the blushing bridegroom yet, you know.".

At one point in episode 799, Lenny says they are in a "corporate" when he means a "cooperative".

Frank misses out a word in episode 805: "I've still got footy programmes when I was his age."; he uses a curious phrase in episode 819: "stamped addressed letters"; and may mean "references" when he says "satisfactory circumstances" in episode 830.

Sheila's revelation in episode 819 that Barry's real father is called "Paddy" contradicts a considerable amount of previous dialogue dating all the way back to the beginning of the series - including some very specific comments to the contrary. And that's even before we find out who this "Paddy" actually is.......

Trivia:

The postcode on the package that arrives addressed to Michael Choi is L43 (798). His "for sale" sign bears the name "G. Samuels" and the telephone number 051 259 6971 (822, 826). The Collins' sign bears the name "Assurance Trust" (797, 800) and the telephone number 051 259 9180 (799, 825). Paul's removalists are Fleet Removals of Liverpool (802). Judith lives at number 6 (796). Gordon doesn't like carrots (796), and meets a man, who he eventually realises is a hooker, with a flat in Drake Street (796).

Chrissy earns £2.50 per hour when working for the estate agents' (802), and £2.10 per hour for temp work (816). Frank was a steel erector when he met her (816). The first record he ever bought was "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" by Eddie Cochran (803). Frank got a parking ticket about four years ago (826), he previously worked at National Chemicals Transport (825), and acts as a roadie for the West Coast Riders (813). He has an audition at the Marias Club (813, 815). There were originally four Scotty Dogs (813). Seen in episode 804, the full text of Frank's father's gravestone reads: "Pte. Jeffrey Rogers, Died 17th October 1954 aged 35 years. Veteran, Burma Campaign 1941-45. When you go home, tell them of us and say for tomorrow we gave our today.". Owen lives in Queens Drive (797).

Sheila has known Terry for about 20 years (809). The telephone number on the door of the cab taking her to her wedding to Billy is 537777 (820). There were 60 at Sheila and Bobby's wedding (813), and Doreen and Billy were married in the morning, with Frankie as best man (820). Cousin Don, who has a dry-cleaning van, hasn't seen Julia for twelve years (821). Joey Godden, who never knew his mother (832) was sentenced to 14 years in prison (804), and served 11 years for the killing of Frankie (826, 832, 833). His locals are "The Swan" and "The British Lion" (832). The bracelet Liam gives Tracy is inscribed "To Tracy, I love you, Liam" (791). Jimmy, who has gone to "The Swan" since he was 15 (832), is left-handed (815, 817); and so is Barry (831).

Jonathan's phone number seems to have changed to 259 5490 - Barry asks to be called back on that number, and the call later comes through (798). According to Martin, Jonathan used to work at "Gilchrist" (802). Sue speculates that Terry and his father may be in the "Red Lion" pub (795). There is a book, "The Essential Henry Longhurst", on her bedside table (791). Later, Sue goes to stay with a mate at 1 Cherrytree Drive, Childwall (831). Josie was working at a shoe shop when she first met Mick (795), who likes spinach (808). She was pregnant with Gemma at the time of the Chernobyl disaster (823).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

According to Jimmy, the cake he has picked up cheaply for Bobby and Sheila was originally ordered by a couple who called off their wedding at the last minute. The icing on its top tier, seen briefly in episode 819, reads: "CONGRATULATIONS, MAVIS AND DEREK".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As Sheila comes out of her class, Kathy runs towards her, sobbing uncontrollably. It is clear that she has some terrible news to reveal to Sheila about the outcome of the Corkhills' latest fight with Joey Godden.......
