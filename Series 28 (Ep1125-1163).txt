The storylines:

Margaret and Derek get engaged, and so do Ellis and Marianne. Sammy and Owen are reconciled, and so are Sinbad and Marcia. But Rod walks out on Diana, and Frank ditches Denise in favour of Lyn. Katie loses a coat and Patricia loses a baby, while Mike makes a film, Jacqui leaves school and gets a job, Tracy gains a new boss, and John discovers a surprising new talent. The opening of a petrol station coincides with the distribution of racial propoganda and threats against the pizza parlour, while Ron and Max are unable to dislodge Jimmy from his rent-free trading on the parade. But when Terry gives Barry the all-clear to return from Spain to Liverpool, he is determined to succeed where others have failed.......

Locations:

While most of the action is set in or near Liverpool, more of it takes place elsewhere than in any previous season. For the first time, a whole episode is set away from the Close - episode 1135 takes place entirely at Alton Towers, Stoke-on-Trent. Then there are scenes in Edinburgh in episodes 1142 and 1143, although those in the latter are only on a camp site that is not recognisably Scottish; and in episodes 1147 and 1149 there are scenes in the house and in the street in which Mrs Clemence lives in Oldham, which do not really appear noticeably different from houses and streets that might be found in or near Liverpool. Diana and Peter are seen on their way back from Manchester to Liverpool in episode 1156, although it is not clear how far away they are; then there is a scene involving Terry and Sinbad in Manchester Airport towards the end of episode 1157, followed by images of their Spain-bound plane in flight. There are then several scenes in Madrid, Spain throughout episodes 1158, 1159 and 1160; and finally, Peter, Diana and Anna are seen somewhere en route from Liverpool to Manchester in episode 1162.

Births:

Bernie was once married (1133); and Brian was married for two years, although it seemed longer (1148). He is now divorced (1160).

Meadowcroft Park is mentioned again, and some of its characters' voices can be heard in the background, in episode 1125, and possibly also in episode 1128.

Goofs:

Terry adds an extra word in episode 1128: "Anybody's probably better OFF at making pizzas than me.".

The tour bus in which the residents set off at the end of episode 1134 bears the name "Maghull Coaches" and the telephone number 051 933 2324, but when they are getting back on to go home near the end of episode 1135 it bears the name "Maghull Tours" and the telephone number 944 1574 !

Lyn misses out the word "it" in episode 1136: "....just finding a bit hard to adjust....".

Mick's third last word in "Where would you dump my stock then?" should probably be "your" in episode 1138.

Max seems torn between "the opportunity didn't arise" and "the time didn't seem right", when he says "the opportunity didn't seem right" in episode 1146.

Diana erroneously refers to Tommo as "Neil" one more time in episode 1161. He still doesn't correct her.

Trivia:

Terry has known Barry, who was recently in Barcelona for the last week of the Olympics (1160), since he was five years old (1149). Jimmy is left-handed (1129). Jackie, who never learned to drive (1143), went to Magaluf once (1138). The "For Sale" sign at number 10 bears the name "Binenan Estates" and the [changed!] telephone number 359 3600 (1148).

DD has been to the Isle of Man (1129). She and Ron, who is right-handed (1150), have always had their anniversary dinner at the "Riverview" (1132, 1134, 1135), but Jacqui discovers that this is only because they each believe the other likes it (1132). Jacqui passes six GCSEs (1142, 1144), and has lined up an interview at Boundary Road Leisure Centre, for a placement on which she will earn Â£29.50 a week (1144). Mike's film is called "Heart", and is premiered at White Hart Inn, Edinburgh on 28th August at 8.00, along with a few others, the first of which is called "Overload" (1142).

Patricia is right-handed (1152) and shops at John Lewis (1137). She read "Tess of the D'urbevilles" at school, and works on the PSS (Personal Service Society) account (1126, 1140, 1152), which Karyn regards as much less important than the Marsden account (1126). David was a pharmacist in the same hospital where Jean worked as a staff nurse (1150). Anna has been in England for four years, dropped out of studying English at college after six months, and spent a year waitressing before becoming a nanny (1125). Margaret helps Derek to fill in a "PS461" form, suggesting that his "former employer" should be "God" (1157).

None of the Harrisons like sardines (1136) [except to shoplift! (1133)]. John, who is right-handed (1129), uses the firm "Jupiter" to install his satellite dish in episode 1126. He went to Edinburgh in 1983 or 1984 (1132), and watches a horse race on television in which the front-runner is "Hedgeclipper" (1136). The videotape he shoplifts from "InterSport" is "Thighs-a-Size" (1138).

Ellis, who is left-handed (1155) visits "Ed Murray Financial Services" to take out a loan (1131). He and Mick buy a van from Ditchburn Truck Services (1155). The pizza parlour on the Parade is listed to be boycotted in "The New Britain", along with Libertus Health Club, Leaf Street, Liverpool; Poccis Restaurant, Waymor St, Netherton; Razello's Night Club, Gaptree Way, Bootle, and Z.C. Tools, Prior Street, Liverpool (1153).

Geoff is now in the first team at Torquay (1160). Owen has put down a deposit on a flat in Oakwood Road (1139). Lyn used to be a dancer (1131, 1163) on the same cruise ship on which her ex-husband Steve was a drummer in the band (1131), but she now works as a doctor's receptionist (1131, 1137) in Welbeck Avenue (1137). She has a cat and some rabbits (1152), and arrives in a taxi bearing the telephone number 480 7777 (1142), as do the Crosbies (1149).

Brian is left-handed (1148). Sharon, one of the stylists at the salon, earns wages of Â£75 (1139). George Webb is the manager of the new garage (1145) which is being built by Rhino Construction, telephone 051 877 4222 (1148). He served in the forces (1151), in Aden and Northern Ireland (1153). The company behind the nightclub is Halsall Leisure (1153).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

The first instance of John shoplifting, in episode 1126, can probably be included under this heading, as he effortlessly shoves a light bulb into his coat pocket. But after that, of course, viewers are aware of the need to watch him closely every time he is in a shop or supermarket.......

In what might be a minor homage to American crime dramas such as "Miami Vice", which has just been mentioned, Ellis and Mick remove their sunglasses simultaneously in episode 1129.

When Frank gives him a Â£10 note to pay for his tickets to Alton Towers in episode 1134, Ron holds it up and checks that it is genuine.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

After Jimmy and Sinbad leave Jimmy's shop, Barry emerges from hiding, pours petrol over the merchandise and sets it alight. He leaves the shop and goes to the payphone on the parade, where a young woman is making a call. She eventually hangs up when he tells her he needs the phone urgently, and when she has gone he dials 999 and asks for the fire brigade. Meanwhile, the fire has reached Jimmy's gas canisters, which explode and fly out through the window into the parade. An alarm starts to sound, as the whole shop is ablaze.......
