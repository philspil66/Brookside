Christian's appearances in episode 2191 are only in flashbacks from episodes 1960 and 1962, which also feature Rachel, Jacqui and Mike.

The Channel Four broadcasts of episodes 2188, 2189, 2190, 2194, 2197 and 2200 were followed by trailers for "Brookie Basics", and the closing music is significantly shorter than usual in these episodes, with the cast and production credits presented in two columns in a much smaller font size. Unusually, in the last of these the closing music fades out rather than reaching its final note.

Scenes at the end of episode 2229 and at the end of part one of episode 2232 are shown in slow-motion.

From the beginning of this season onwards, "Brookside" is shown in a widescreen format.

The storylines:

Jimmy somehow manages to keep his teaching job - but when he misses a holiday abroad by getting drunk, Jackie leaves him again and moves in next door with Lindsey, who manages to overcome threats to the success of the "Millennium Club" from the Finnegans, including the not-quite-as-dead-as-she-thought Callum. Anthea overcomes a health scare and agrees to marry Ron, and Mike overcomes Rachel's fear of relationships enough to get her pregnant. Doctor Darren, website designer Victoria, and solictor Nathan - a despised boss for Katie, but a new lover for Jacqui - move into a flat on the parade, and Harry Cross briefly makes a surprise return to the Close. A visit from his daughter Ruth doesn't do as much to relieve Sinbad's depression as he might have hoped, Mick worries about Jerome's influence over Leo, and Katrina finds it a strain to cope with looking after Susannah's two babies. Kelly and Emily remain friends, Alec and Jessie become closer, and the fists of both Greg and Ryan briefly make contact with the other main suspect, Harvey - but the Shadwicks and Musgroves hope for very different outcomes as further evidence is gathered, and Luke's trial for the drug-rape of Nikki draws near.......

It is Friday in episode 2211; it will be four years on Tuesday since Mandy and Beth were found guilty of murder in episode 2213; and Friday 4th June is "not for another two weeks" in episodes 2217 and 2218. Based on documents seen in episode 2217, it is Tuesday 25th May in episode 2218 and Friday 4th June 1999 in episode 2223; based on dialogue in episode 2224, it is Wednesday in episode 2227; and based on dialogue in episode 2225, it is Friday in episode 2226. Based on dialogue in episodes 2228 and 2229, it is Saturday in the former and Sunday / Father's Day in the latter. A banner reading "Glastonbury Festival - June 25th 26th 27th" seen in episode 2231 would suggest, albeit not conclusively, that this episode is set on or before these dates.

However, only the last two of these episodes include scenes - for example, those outside the "Excalibur Cafe" - that are identifiably recorded at the location at which they are set.

The following unseen and never-to-be seen characters who are no longer alive are also mentioned: Helen, Alec's wife, who died of breast cancer in her early 30's / Niamh's mother (2196 / 2208); Tommy, Jessie's husband, who died ten years ago (2196); Jackie's father, who worked on the docks (2196); Lindsey's uncle Franky (2199); Callum's father (2209); Jerome's father (2201, 2218, 2220, 2223, 2229), who used to be in the building game before he went into community work (2218); the wife of old Mr Andrews, a client of Nathan (2215); Megan's "father" (2220, 2222); and Tim's father (2229). Callum also recalls the death of his mate Benny, who had been seen in the video-only episode "The Lost Weekend", but did not appear in any broadcasted episode (2203).

And, in episode 2188, Lindsey is seen taking delivery of a parcel addressed to Peter Phelan.

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Sean (2196) and Paul (2196, 2217), Niamh's brothers; Alan Brown, a scaffolder who lived in the same street as Jackie, and Paula McMahon, who once slept with him (2198); Rolf, Callum's faithful sniffer-dog (2199); Mark Jenkins, a friend of Matt (2200); Aggie, a "Great Granny" (2200); Mrs McKenna, a "Great Grannies" customer (2200); Melissa, a friend of Kelly (2200); Hilary's husband, who ran off with his 32-year-old P.A.

Goofs:

The "Great Grannies" flier briefly seen on-screen in episode 2193 includes one bad spelling mistake: "Grab yourself a Great Granny! First class service - Babysitting, Child Minding, Domestic Maintainence. Ring now on 0151 269 5341. Great Grannies Agency - there when you need them!"

A piece of hate-mail received by the Musgroves in episode 2194 has the same wording both times it is seen on-screen: "Your son is a RAPIST - If the court doesn't sort him today, I will." But when it first arrives, the words are spread across four lines; and when Kelly later rescues it from the bin, the words are only spread across three lines!

In episode 2202 we see a list Lindsey has made of the five clubs from which Callum is collecting his extortion money - "Rigby's", "Blue's". "Othello's", "Mallan's" and "Bevan's". However, after he is seen collecting from "Othello's", the next one he visits - his second last call - is actually "Barbed".

Katie pluralises "table" instead of "time" in episode 2209: "I've probably got a surprise test on my time tables coming up.".

In episode 2231, Matt shows Bosko the frontispiece of an old book he has found, showing only the title, author and publisher - "The Story of Shad", Dr M. Wilson, Groves - but doesn't turn the page before they both start to read out brief extracts from the text inside.

Trivia:

Joey once played bass in a band, but he damaged his hand jumping off a bridge when drunk, and originally met Niamh at the hospital where he was then treated (2206). Rose brought Luke up for 12 years (2218, 2219, 2225) in Dublin (2218). Harvey's room in the university halls of residence is number 20a, and the university gym in which Nikki, who has shopped at "Harrod's" while in London with Margi (2230), is found is in Aspen Street (2216). The headline in a Thursday edition of the "Echo" seen twice in episode 2217 is "Drug rape accused flees hospital bed", and the article begins: "A Liverpool man being held on remand charged with drugging and then raping a nineteen year old student has". Winning racehorses selected by Jessie, to the surprise of Alec, a reader of "Racing Post" (2199, 2209) are "Life's Rich Tapestry", "A Girl Called Jeff" (at 33/1) and "Slow Collier". Other tenants listed on the doorbells of Jayne's residence are Stu Priest, J. Laurence, D. Horace and Charlotte Bowman (2227).

Nathan, who is working on "the Jenkins case" (2223), Victoria, who is from Ellesmere Port (2231) and works for "World Wide Web Weavers" in Manchester (2223), and Darren were at university together (2221, 2223), Nathan and Victoria shared a house, and Darren joined them when he started at medical school (2223). The reference number on the letter dated 20th May 1999, which Anthea receives from Cancer Research Unit, Royal Liverpool Hospital, Prescot Street, Liverpool L1 in episode 2217 is Dix/28GH. It states that her appointment is at 10.30 am on Friday 4th June 1999 - but Ron then makes an earlier one, according to his notes, on Tuesday 25th May at 2.30pm, with Dr Wallace at Willowbank Private Health Centre. The electricity bill Ron receives for his shop is for £399.00 (2189).

Susannah recalls scattering her children's ashes at Dove Point nearly two years ago in episode 2199. The wording on the card with the flowers she receives in episode 2196 is: "Susannah, I'm sorry about everything that's happened. Thinking of you today. If it's OK with you, can I see you Max xx". Lindsey hires a car from "Acute Car Hire", whose telephone number is 0151-692-6838 (2201), and goes to the Finnegans' in a "Maple Cars" taxi (2209); Ryan is seen driving the same "Goldline Taxis" Joey had previously driven, bearing the telephone number 0151-269-9696, although the taxi number is now 3024 (2204); and the Corkhills set off for the airport crammed into a ridiculously small taxi from Manor Car Line, bearing the telephone number 269 6699 (2222). Once there, Jimmy gets drunk at "The Viscount Bar" (2222). Jackie's first job after she left school was at Tate & Lyle (2196); Barry's company, owner of the "Millennium Club", is "Grant-Starr Holdings" (2207); and Kevin, Harry's son, lives in Maghull (2191).

The telephone number 0151 269 5941 is seen again on Greg's van in episodes 2201, 2202 and 2229, and supplies are brought to him on a van bearing the company name "Beesley & Fildes Ltd" in episode 2213. The telephone number on the "For Sale, One Owner" sign Alec attaches to his car in episode 2212 is 0151 672 5176; and Jimmy's forged certificate from Sheffield University, bearing the name "Martin James Corkhill", is seen again in episode 2194. Roger Abbott reads "The Daily Telegraph" (2211); and there is still a poster of George Clooney on the wall of Nikki's bedroom in episode 2195, and art by Ansel Adams (2207, 2209) and Claude Monet (2209, 2215) in the solicitors' office. Niamh (2190, 2205), Frank (2190), Jacqui (2208, 2211, 2217, 2218), Katie (2209), Mick (2210), Jayne (2211), Susannah (2213, 2216, 2217), Alec (2214), Margi (2215), Lindsey (2216), Nikki (2225), Rachel (2226), Katrina (2226), Kylie (2228) and Leo (2229) are right-handed, while Nathan (2207), Jimmy (2210, 2214), and Mike (2229) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

The somewhat typo-ridden letter Susannah receives from "Jones & Patterson - Exceptionally Fine Food Supplies" in episode 2195 suggests that they don't employ exceptionally fine typists. It reads as follows:

Dear
Miss S. Morrisey

Following our recent conversation concerning the matter of the outstanding bill of £1010.5

I regret to inform you that the bill has not been payed and if the matter is not resolved after 7 working days, legal action will be taken.

Yours
Faithfully

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Although the outcome of the drug-rape trial will not be known until the next season, perhaps it can be predicted from the closing cliffhanger of this one....... Nikki looks across the Close, watching Niamh washing her windows, and wishing that the trial was already finished. Greg assures her that he and her mother don't want her suffering any more than she already has, and reminds her that she will only have one opportunity to make sure the jury believe her. "It'll be all right, Nik' - they're going to lock him up and throw away the key. This time next week, it'll all be over, eh?"
