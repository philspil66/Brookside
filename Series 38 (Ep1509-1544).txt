This season was the second of eight that were repeated, initially at an unprecedented rate, on digital satellite television. All 36 of these episodes were aired on Sky One in October/November 2001 (ten per week!). However, due to poor ratings, plans to continue with the next season in the same time-slot were abandoned, and the series was removed from the schedules for a few weeks.

Trevor Jordache's appearances in episode 1521 are images and dialogue repeated from several earlier episodes (as Mandy has a nightmare about the events of the past) and glimpses of his hand, as played by a stand-in.

The storylines:

Barry tries and fails to bed Emma, who insists that the first man she sleeps with will be the one she marries. When she proposes to him, however, he does a runner. Mo seems to have found a man in the form of local publican Kevin - but unfortunately it's her sister Rosie that he really fancies. Meanwhile, Mike is rejected by Beth, and begins a secret relationship with Carl's wife Sarah - but that doesn't work out either. And after DD is persuaded that moving to Bolton is preferable to committing suicide, Bev moves in with Ron, and adds several chickens to their family - but most of them only survive for a day or two.

However, there are two major storylines that dominate this season. Firstly, the body of Trevor is discovered under the patio of number 10, causing the Jordaches to go on the run with Sinbad. Eventually they are caught, charged with murder, and start getting hate-mail. Secondly, a mystery virus strikes the Close, which needs to be quarantined as several residents are taken ill. There are already two deaths - young Garry Salter, and Audrey's estranged husband George, who has returned from overseas with a view to ripping off as many people as possible. But is one of his victims, Jean, also about to become the third victim of the plague?

The dates:

Based on the "Medicine Ball" banner, it is 1995 in episode 1510; Elvis Presley would have been 60 this Sunday in episode 1511; and it is the middle of January in episode 1513, in which we are also told that Christmas finished three weeks ago, and dog licences were abolished three years ago! It is Friday in episode 1514; it is Tuesday in episode 1518; and, based on dialogue in episode 1522, it is Friday in episode 1524. It is the Chinese Year of the Pig in episode 1523; it is Tuesday, and Valentine's Day, in episode 1529; and it is Friday in episode 1534. It is Ash Wednesday in episode 1536; and, based on dialogue in episode 1535, it is Friday in episode 1537. It is the 90's in episode 1538; and, based on dialogue in episode 1543, it was Tuesday in episode 1541. There is a 1995 calendar on Bev's kitchen wall in episode 1523, and a sign on the church wall in episode 1538 refers to "LENT 1995".

Locations:

While most of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, there are several scenes of the Jordaches, Sinbad and others in Ireland throughout episodes 1521, 1522, 1523, 1524, and 1525. Among the locations they visit are Johnson's Cafe, Dun Laoghaire (1523), Molloy's Coffee Shop / Delicatessen, which is number 14 (1523), and Dergvale Hotel, Dublin (1524). In episode 1534 there are some scenes in a "Cheshire hotel", although there are no further indications of where in Cheshire this might be. And there would seem to be no clear clues at all as to the whereabouts of the racing enclosure, the hotel, and the roadside in which several characters are seen in in episodes 1536 and 1537, nor the coach on which some of them are seen travelling. They have, however, journeyed "all this way", only to break down "in the middle of nowhere" and "off the beaten track" (1536).

Births:

None, although Audrey's unseen, unnamed niece in Leeds is apparently expecting "any day" (1538), and it is Sinbad's birthday in episode 1520. Rosie's 40th birthday, which arrives in episode 1537, is "next week" (1533) / "this Friday" (1535) / and "tomorrow" [even though it is currently Ash Wednesday !!] (1536). We are also told that Josh was one year old on Christmas Day (1511); Mick is 36 (1516); Rebecca is 4 (1517, 1529); Rachel is 16 (1523); Alice is six months old (1535); Thomas is 6 (1543); and Beth was born on 18th August 1975 (1543). David's reaction on reading a newspaper article suggests, however, that the press have been even more inaccurate than usual when giving his age as "83" (1525)!

Marriages:

None. We never find out the name of Kevin's late wife, but it is seven years ago to the day (Valentine's Day) that he married her in episode 1529.

Deaths:

Seven! Three of Bev's chickens - Kentucky, Nugget and Buttie - become blood and feathers overnight for reasons unknown in episode 1529. Two more - Ham Pie and Fried Rice - are further victims of the unidentified chicken-killer the next night in episode 1530. Then Garry Salter, at the end of episode 1539, and George Manners, at the end of episode 1541, are the first two victims of a mystery plague - although Audrey attributes the death of her husband, which occurred on a Tuesday (1543), to "terminal greed" (1542).

Trevor Jordache's coffin, bearing the dates 1950-1993, is seen again in episode 1524, and Tony Dixon's gravestone is seen in the background, but not sufficiently clearly for the wording to be fully read, in episode 1514. Two unseen characters who are no longer alive are also mentioned: Eddie's mother (1515), and Kevin's wife, who died five years ago (1516) in a car accident (1528).

Toilet visits:

Cracker (1509, 1513, 1515, 1527, 1530, 1544); Jean (1513); Mo (1518, 1528); Rachel (1530); Emma (1531); Mike (1537); Beth OOV (1538); Garry (1539); and Thomas (1542). According to Ron, Kiev is doing his "business" all over the house (1525); and David needs to go in episode 1518, but unfortunately he is trapped in Ron's loft.

Goofs:

Ron's maths fails him when he confronts Jimmy in episode 1530 - Kentucky, Nugget, Buttie, Ham Pie and Fried Rice are apparently "Four chickens killed in two days".

Jacqui adds an "S" to her father's new house name in episode 1533: "Casa Bevrons".

Having already revealed in episode 1535 that Rosie's birthday is "this Friday", Eddie says in episode 1536, when it is Ash Wednesday, that it is "tomorrow".......

Max overemphasises the factual nature of his argument in episode 1538: "But, in fact, our true vision is, in fact, wide".

According to Max in episode 1539, "We just need to dot the T's and cross the I's on this VAT return".

Trivia:

Amanda Jane Jordache (1528) and Elizabeth Anne Jordache (1543) are accused of murdering Trevor, who was over six feet tall, and was released from prison after a two-year sentence for assault in early 1993 (1526), on or about 7th May 1993 (1528). While on the run in Ireland, to which they travel on a ship marked "Stena Sealink" and "Stena Hibernia" (1520), Sinbad and Mandy adopt the alias "Mr and Mrs Todd" (1521), and Rachel, who has her GCSEs this year (1520), dials 010 44 51 722 9122 in an attempt to reach Lee (1523). Beth, who gets a video of a Swedish film "My Life As A Dog" for her night in with Viv (1515), was 14 when Trevor slept with her (1526). The video brought by Viv, who is a trainee lab-tech[nician] (1510), is "The Getaway" (1515). Kenny's company is "Maguire Holdings Ltd" (1511), and his office is in the same building as "Staithe Group Associates" (1511).

Rosie has been a traffic warden in Maud Street (1514). Her wedding ring was Eddie's mother's (1515), and "Success", by M. Jackson Brown Junior, appears on her wall calendar (1529). "Kojock", who Eddie recognises on Mo's "Select-A-Hunk" tape, is a bald Glasgewian with bad breath, who drives a fork lift truck at Litrotech (1512). In preparation for a course on "Workers' Awareness", Eddie is seen looking at a file including "Module 1 - The Work Module" and a diagram of "The Grapevine" (1524). Kevin's pub, which runs a "singles night" on Fridays (1512), and, according to a poster on the wall, a "Karaoke Challenge" on Sundays (1517), is "The Peacock" (1512, 1517, 1520). He is teetotal (1520, 1525), and used to manage the "Ocean Star" (1528). Audrey lives in Blundell Sands (1518). George disappeared with her jewellery seven years ago, after telling her that he was just going out to get some battered cod and chips (1535).

Barry, whose hotel room is number 525 (1534), is left-handed (1510, 1512, 1530, 1535, 1539, 1540), and is not a member of the AA (1536). DD used to be an Elvis fan (1511). Mike has a poster of Morrisey on his bedroom wall (1513). David's call sign is still "Golf Two Lima Romeo Romeo", and he tries to contact "Lima Alpha One Delta Foxtrot Quebec" (1513). Bev has bought her fence at B&Q (1520); and the nursery that accepts Josh and rejects Alice (1528) is in Garford Road (1521), while another nursery that does accept Alice charges £90 per week (1534). Ron got his current television for Charles and Di[ana]'s wedding, so it has lasted longer than their marriage did (1538). Jimmy is left-handed, and Max is right-handed (1539). Gemma has "Barbie" and "Ken" dolls, renaming the latter after Garry when he dies (1541). The doctor responsible for Thomas, according to the sign above his hospital bed, is "Dr Richards" (1544).

Several newspaper headlines are seen on-screen during this season: "Liverpool Bin-Bag Body Mystery" by Paul Muldowney (1522); "Window Cleaner Wanted In Bin-Bag Body Mystery" (1523); "Body in Bin-Bag Found" (1523); "Police On Scent Of Dog Discovery" (1525); "House Of Horrors Gangland Secret - Ran Rings Around Police" (1530); and "Body In Garden Girl In Gay Sex Storm" (1531). The last two are tabloids! The note Beth receives in episode 1543, made out of newspaper cuttings, reads "Dyke, B:tch, Whore, Natural Born Killer, Elizabeth Anne Jordache, 18 08 75". Taxis from "Manor Car Line", bearing the telephone number 269 6699, are seen again in episodes 1515, 1521, 1543 and 1544.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

There is the opportunity to learn a little Gaelic from the bilingual signs seen during scenes set in Ireland - in episode 1523, "Enquiries" is "Fiafraithe", and in episode 1524, "Reception" is "Ionad Failte".

Clues that George is a con-artist start coming thick and fast from around the middle of episode 1538, including a purely visual one - while he is welcoming Jean to "paradise" as she is signing her contract, he is covering up most of its text with his hand!

Also in episode 1538, Ron is talking about whether "Coronation Street" is best viewed on a normal or a widescreen television.......or is he? "I like 'Corrie' the way it is - square.".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

The residents leave their meeting at Barry's, with mixed views on how best to approach the epidemic. David suggests that they follow the medical advice they have been given, but Bev wants to leave the Close immediately. Ron is concerned about who will run his business if he can't, but Mick agrees with David. Eddie wants to go back to work, and Rosie believes Carl's recovery indicates that they are over the worst. Mick reminds her of the other fatalities and those currently suffering, and Ron wonders why Dr Houghton is not also confined to the Close. The doctor responds that he is needed at the hospital and will be monitored there. But Jimmy then appears from the back of the bungalow, having retrieved a runaway Cracker, and reveals that he thinks Jean is dead! David and Dr Houghton dash to attend to her, as Mick's mind is made up: "Over the worst, are we? Right. We're setting up that cordon right away. And we're all going to man it. No-one goes out, no-one comes in till we know what the hell's going on......."
