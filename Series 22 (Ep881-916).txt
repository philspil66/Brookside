APPEARING AS THEMSELVES:
Members of the band "The Farm" (909-911)

Episode 881 is the last to open and close with the original version of the theme tune: a new version is used from episode 882 onwards.

Episode 886, involving the Dixon family, and episode 916, involving the Rogers family, are the first two that feature just one single household throughout.

The storylines:

Barry, Josie and others are looking for new opportunities to make money, while Terry and Sue are looking into their prospects of having another baby, and Mick and Mike are both seeking justice, but in entirely different ways. Max gets a new job and Ron secures a new shop, but Tony's pranks do nothing to improve relations between the Dixons and the Farnhams, and it looks as if war is about to be declared. Meanwhile, there are new romantic partners for Tracy, Geoff and especially Sammy, whose choice, 39-year old Tim, is something of a disappointment to Chrissy and Frank - but will their efforts to persuade her to think again have any effect, or just make things a whole lot worse?

The dates:

It is New Year's Eve, then New Year's Day, in episode 882; it is still New Year's Day in episode 883; it is Friday in episode 885; and it is Monday in episode 887. Based on dialogue in episodes 887 and 888, it is Wednesday in episode 889 and Friday in episode 890. It is January in episode 891; January 28th in episode 894; and, based on earlier dialogue, it is Wednesday in episode 895 and Thursday in episode 896. It is Monday in episode 897; and Friday in episode 899, based on dialogue in episode 897. It is pancake day in episode 900; it is Valentine's Day and 1991 in episode 901; and it is Friday in episode 902, when we are told that Mick's attack on Brady, seen in episode 875, was on Friday 14th December. It is Friday in episode 905, based on dialogue in episode 906; and it is Friday 8th in episode 911, based on dialogue in episode 910 and a desk calendar. It is Wednesday in episode 913, based on dialogue in episode 914, when it is Friday; and, based on dialogue in episode 915, it is Wednesday in episode 916.

Births:

None. The characters whose ages are commented on most often are Sammy, who was born six months after her parents married in January (904), and is now 17 (903, 904, 908, 916) / nearly 18 (903, 905, 908) / 18 in a few months (908); and Tim, who is 39 (903, 908, 916) which is "a couple of years" younger than Frank (908, 916). We are also told that Mike is 17 (882, 885); Tony is 13 (887, 900); Max is 30 (894); Leo is 7 (895); Susannah is a year younger than Max (895); Cyril was 13 in 1938 (900); Mick was born on 12th March 1958 (902); Bumper is 16 (913); Geoff is 16 (913) / not yet 18 (916); and Thomas is nearly 2 (915).

Toilet visits:

After wanting to go in episode 886, but being forbidden by his father, Mike Dixon breaks Gail's record from episode 413 for the fastest peeing in the history of "Brookside" in episode 887. After he tells Tony "I'm going for a slash", his elapsed time between leaving the living-room and re-entering it is just 28 seconds. Gina (890), Mick (902), Lorraine (902), Paula (902), Gary (903), Ronnie (903), Margaret (903), Davver (906), Josie (908) and Daniel (911) just aren't in the same league!

Ron also claims that he was robbed while in the toilet in episode 891; Jimmy reads extracts from Sinbad's diary, which records that he went to the toilet on a Monday and a Tuesday, in episode 894; Tony claims to have the "runs" in episode 899; and Rod says he was "bursting" while out buying a shower in a supermarket in episode 908.

Also mentioned are the following characters from "Meadowcroft Park", a new lunchtime soap set in the south which has been going for a few weeks (897); the Tulleys, Tommy (897); Tess (897); Titus (897); Tarquin (897, 902, 916); Timmy (897); Tulula (897); and Tania (897); the Burketts (897); Tarty Evelyn (902, 916); Camilla, a "dog" who Margaret apparently sounds like (906); and Harold (906). Ron assures DD that he asked Tony to tape it for her (899); Paula thinks Geoff looks like Tarquin (902); and some of the characters' voices are heard in the background in episode 906, as Tony watches Margaret's videoed copy after DD has forgotten to set theirs, and in episode 916, when Katie watches it until Frank, who says it's rubbish, asks her to turn it off!

Goofs:

In episode 882, "up" is in the wrong place as Jacqui says: "Trying to drag every woman up in sight to dance".

Torn between "irrespective" and "regardless" in episode 888, Patricia invents a new word: "irregardless".

At one point in episode 891, Ron refers to Mike as "Our Mick".

Whereas most solicitors might lay it ON the line, Mick's says "Let me lay this DOWN the line" in episode 900.

With hindsight, it seems odd that Diana should bring "Scrabble" over to play with Rod in episode 905.......

Trivia:

Rod is right-handed (881). Tracy now has "about 40" customers (907). Jimmy claims that Billy used to love Abba (898), whereas he, like Josie (899) is a fan of the music of Boney M (898, 899), including "Brown Girl In The Ring" (898). The book he was given for his birthday, from which he has been quoting occasionally ever since, is seen in episode 897, and is called "Factually Speaking". The telephone number of Fisher's Frozen Foods in Bethnal Green, London, is 081 985 9805 (881). Sealed bids for the shop fitting tender have been received from Sedgeley's and Hewitsons' (914).

According to Ron, who has not smoked for 2 years (886), the name on the cash-and-carry card he has borrowed and loans out is "Jack Nabbit" (881). Jacqui, who has a poster of Tanita Tikaram on her bedroom wall (886), and Mike, who is doing "A" levels (914) and is left-handed (889), are checked in at the police station by a sergeant who is right-handed (885). Tony drank half a bottle of Martini, and had his stomach pumped, on his 7th birthday (886). Cyril was in the Merchant Navy (883). Sinnott's locker at Brookside Comprehensive School, whose sign listing the headmaster as Mr Woodcock is seen again (888, 889), is number 12 (889).

Patricia had a "short" career in the Brownies (915). Max, who says he cheated in his "A" levels (888), plays "Scrabble" with Patricia, who scores handsomely with "knobber", the spelling and meaning of which he verifies from a dictionary (887). Their phone bill is for £237.31, but when Max checks it he can only find about £5 worth of calls to Oldham (912) made by Margaret, who dropped out of college (894). Susannah, a good cook (893), married Max when they were students (895), and became pregnant in Max's final year (895). The earliest guesses as to whether "Max" is short for anything come from DD, who refers to "Mr Maxwell Farnham" (899), and Ron, who calls him "Pope Maximilian" (914).

Michael Andrew Johnson (902) is 6'2" tall amd weighs about 15 stone, whereas Kenneth James Brady is 5'7" and just under 10 stone (900). It would appear that Josie has seen "Doctor Who", as she mentions a TARDIS (888). Leo goes to Manor Park Primary School (889). Chrissy first slept with Frank when she was 17, and became pregnant in her third year of college (916). Geoff doesn't shave yet (905). Tim's job is Group Marketing Manager (907). He is left-handed (907). Ronnie now works for an insurance broker (890), while Gina and Nigel are both teachers (890). Terry, whose father used to be a miner (883), answers the telephone at number 9 with its last four digits, which are now 9004 (881).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Members of the band "The Farm" can be seen in episodes 909, 910 and 911. Each of their appearances is in a scene involving Geoff, who is trying to spot them, but completely fails to notice them every time!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

After a series of arguments about Sammy's involvement with a 39-year-old man, Katie pulls apart her Spanish dancing costume and runs upstairs, believing that Chrissy only married Frank because she had to, and has regretted it ever since. Frank blames this on Sammy, who retorts that she hopes he is happy now. Chrissy says she doesn't know what's happening any more; Sammy leaves the house to go back to Tim, and doesn't hear Frank having the last word: "If I ever get my hands on him, I'll kill him. I'm telling you, I'll kill him!".
