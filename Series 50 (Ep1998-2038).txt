The Magic Rabbits are seen again in episodes 2004 (watched by Tim), 2010 (watched by Tim and Sharon) and 2019 (not really watched by Kylie).

All of the closing credits apart from "A Mersey Television Production" were removed from the original Channel Four broadcast of episode 2033, rescheduled into a 25-minute timeslot.

Episode 2034 is the first with only three credited cast members - Jacqui, Susannah and [shop assistant] Sylvia.

The storylines:

The Shadwicks - Greg, Margi, Jason, Nikki, Emily and Candy the dog - move into the bungalow after David falls in love with Molly, and leaves the Close forever to live with her in a magnificent mansion he didn't even know about. Mick's quality of life also improves, as he is found not guilty of murder; there are promotions for Rachel and Cassie, and some dodgy money-making opportunities for Tim when he finally gets a job. But Louise's increasing determination to meet her imprisoned father concerns Eleanor, and strains her relationship with Ollie, while Lindsey wonders if she can rebuild her relationship with Peter, after Barry goes back to a wife and children elsewhere. Meanwhile, Jacqui's first three months of pregnancy on Susannah and Max's behalf don't always go quite as smoothly or secretly as they might have hoped, and she is not easily forgiven by Ron when he loses his share in "Bar Brookie", falls on hard times, and needs to economise wherever possible - even when he needs a gas cooker installing.......

The dates:

In court, reference is made to Gladys's death on 2nd July 1997 (1998) and statements Mick gave on 20th August 1997 (1998) and 22nd October 1997 (1998), all of which events were seen in the episodes that were originally broadcast on each of these dates (1912, 1934 and 1961). It is January 1998, according to the calendar seen on the wall of Eleanor's office in episode 2011 [maybe Katie has forgotten to turn the page.......]; and it is Friday in episode 2014.

Two of Ron's recent IOUs examined by Jacqui in episode 2015 are dated "7th Feb 1998" and "10th Feb '98"; it is Friday again in episode 2017; and, based on dialogue in episode 2020, it is Tuesday in episode 2021. If September is "in six months", it must be March in episode 2023; and, based on dialogue in episode 2026, 2027 and 2028, it is Thursday in episode 2028 and Friday in episode 2029, in which it can be seen that the tax-disc on Susannah's car expires at the end of March 1998.

Based on dialogue in episode 2029, it is Wednesday in episode 2031, in which Eleanor dictates a letter in response to one written on 5th March 1998, regarding a case which has been adjourned to 20th April - not Monday 13th April 1998, which is Easter Monday.

It is Tuesday in episode 2036; and, based on dialogue in episodes 2033, 2035 and 2036, it is Thursday in episode 2034 and it is Friday in episode 2035, when it is also a year since Matthew and Emily died - an anniversary that is "in six weeks' time" in episode 2000, and "next week" in episode 2032. Peter says it is "the calm before the Bank Holiday weekend storm" in episode 2037.

Births:

None, although Jacqui confirms that she is pregnant, and is due to give birth on September 9th, in episode 2011. She is nine weeks' pregnant in episode 2020, the birth is six months away in episodes 2030, 2033 and 2035, and she is 14 weeks pregnant in episodes 2033 and 2034.

It is Katie's birthday in episode 2016; it is Mick's 40th birthday, which is "soon" in episode 2021 and "tomorrow" in episode 2022, in episode 2023; it would have been Matthew's birthday on Sunday in episode 2027; it is Rachel's 19th birthday in episode 2029; and it is Ben's birthday in episode 2036. In episode 2021 it is the birthday of Lauren Smallbridge, a yet-to-be-seen friend of Kylie, which is "next week" in episode 2019; and it is the birthday of the yet-to-be-seen mother of Susannah soon in episode 2032.

We are told that Jacqui is 21 (2001, 2031); Steven is 5 (2002); Ruth is 2 (2004); Tim is nearly 18 (2005); Ron is 50 (2006, 2009, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2028, 2029, 2032); Jimmy is "near 50" (2013); Mike is 24 (2016); Leo is 15 (2023); David says he is "getting on for 65" (2027); Louise is 18 (2027, 2028, 2031, 2033); Eleanor was 18 nearly 20 years ago (2028); Lindsey is 25 (2032); Katie is the same age as Jacqui (2034); and, although Emily is 14 and Jason is 20 (2036), Margi says that she has "three teenagers" (2038).

Marriages:

None. Cliff says he has been married for 20 years (2031).

Deaths:

None. Unseen characters mentioned who are no longer alive are: Carmel's father (2006); Tim's father, who died when Tim was little (2006); Molly's mother-in-law, Beattie/Edie, who has died peacefully (2011), and whose funeral Molly and David attend (2012); and Molly's husband Norman (2012, 2014, 2029), who bought his mother a coffin for her 80th birthday (2012), and died less than a year after retiring (2014).

Toilet visits:

Katie (1999 and 2013), Ruth (2004), Luke (2016), David (2019 and 2024), Ron (2020 and 2030), Cassie (2028), and Emily (2035). David doesn't meet Molly's mother-in-law, the unseen Beattie - later to become the recently-deceased Edie - because she is in the toilet when he visits in episode 2003.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Marcus / Marcus Seddon B.Sc M.Sc / Marcus Seddon (2003, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2027, 2028, 2030, 2033, 2035, 2037 / 2004 / 2008, 2013, 2014); Demi (2007, 2032) and Lauren Smallbridge / Lauren (2018 / 2019, 2020, 2021), friends of Kylie; and Susannah's mother (2032).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Elaine Johnson / Elaine (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 / 2004, 2005); Gladys Charlton / Gladys / Mrs Charlton / Cassie's mother (1998, 1999, 2000 / 2001, 2004 / 2005 / 2032); Detective "Inspector" Anderson (1999); Matthew / Matt (1999, 2000, 2002, 2012, 2014, 2020, 2025, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035 / 2021); Emily / Em [Farnham] (1999, 2000, 2002, 2025, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035 / 2012, 2014, 2021); the Finnegans (2000, 2001, 2009, 2026) / [Callum] Finnegan (2017, 2018); Steven (2002); Fran (2002); Bel (2003, 2021); Little Jimmy / Jimmy (2003, 2006, 2008, 2018 / 2005); Jack Sullivan (2003); Tom (2003, 2015, 2018, 2037) and Joan (2003, 2015, 2018, 2022, 2037), Louise's parents (2031); Christian (2004, 2010, 2016); Beth (2004, 2028); Mandy (2004); Marcia (2005); Jean (2006, 2014, 2022, 2025); Bev (2006, 2019, 2038); Jenny (2007, 2023, 2027); Val (2008, 2012, 2027); Tony (2010, 2016, 2026, 2034, 2035); Simon (2010); JC Bradley (2012, 2017); Dolly Sparrow (2013); Patricia (2014, 2025); Sammy (2016, 2021); Louise (2016); Geoff (2016); Christian's mother (2016); Josh (2016); Audrey Manners (2021, 2022); Renee [Doreen] (2024); Cracker (2028); DD (2031, 2034, 2038); Tom, the woollyback from Bolton (2034); and Shane (2035).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Dr Gwelth, who Sinbad is called to see in room 3 (2001); Pam, Barry's wife, formerly "Miss Letchworth 1992", and their two little daughters (2002); "Beattie" [ see "Deaths", "Toilet visits" and "Goofs"! ] (2003); Eleanor's father (2004, 2005); Dibble, a mate of Tim (2004, 2007); Abigail Harding, who is entering a plea at the Crown Court (2006)); Emily Devine, a client of Eleanor (2006); "Wild Bill" Jenkins, country musician (2007); Nick, bike shop worker (2009, 2022); Mrs Jones (2010) / Mr Foster (2013) / Mrs Andrews (2013) / Mrs Turner (2038), customers of Greg; Gordon, chef at "Grants" (2012); Sharon's father (2012, 2019); one or two "ancient" cousins of the late Norman (2012); Stephen Marsden (2013) / Mary Dalton (2015), the next DSS appointments after Ron; Michael Mirquin, of the previously-mentioned hair salon sponsors "Michael Mirquin International" (2018, 2020) and his personal assistant, Pam Young (2018); Miss Pearce, Leo's teacher (2019); Claire and Dawn, salon employees (2021); Hayley, a friend of Gemma (2021); Bernie, a supplier of Greg (2024); and Nigel, a friend of Louise in Reading (2027).

Goofs:

When Mick was last in court (in episode 926), his full name was Michael Andrew Johnson - but this time it is Michael Anthony Johnson (1998, 2000). Also in court, in episode 1999, reference is made to the earlier interview made with Elaine by Detective INSPECTOR Anderson, although at the time he was Detective SERGEANT Anderson. [ Perhaps he has since been promoted? ]

Eleanor omits the word "was" in episode 2003: "The law society meeting cancelled."; Mo switches an "m" and "r" around in episode 2005, referring to Harry "Marsden" instead of "Ramsden" as a potential supplier for the chip shop; and Lindsey adds an extra "where" in episode 2007: "Where would we have told me mum where the money came from, eh?".

Having previously referred to her mother-in-law as "Beattie" in episode 2003, Molly refers to her as "Edie" at her funeral in episode 2012.......and, in episode 2014, David tells Molly that, after he retired at the age of 53, he and Jean moved to Majorca, and they were there for five years - but he was seen both leaving for, and coming back from, Spain during the same year - 1992 - so he was actually there for less than five months!!

It seems nonsensical that Jacqui and Ron are unable to reach agreement in episode 2017 from the positions they declare. Ron is wanting £1,000 per week, and Jacqui is offering £5,000 upfront and £400 per week, which Ron refuses. Surely, being the good businesswoman that Jacqui is, she should have agreed to give Ron the £1,000 per week that he asks for, using her £5,000 to cover the first five weeks' payments, then her five weeks' £400 per week to cover a further two weeks' payments - which would get her father back on-side for at least seven weeks, and give her that long to find a way of continuing to keep him happy.......

Max omits an "-ing" and adds an "again" while talking to Tim in episode 2024: "You were practically demolish my fence." / "That's the last time you take a short cut through my property again".

The postcode beginning "L16" on the envelope in which Marcus has redirected a letter to Louise, seen briefly in episode 2027, is inconsistent with all previous revelations of the postcode of Brookside Close - although a similar letter seen in episode 2033 shows the "correct" postcode, L43 6TZ!

Eleanor omits the middle syllable from the word "malleable" in episode 2028.

Trivia:

The trial of Michael Antony Johnson (1998, 2000) takes place in Court One (1998, 2001). The card with the flowers Jenny sends to him after he is found not guilty bears the scribbled address "Styal Womens' Prison & YOI, Wimslow, Cheshire SK9 4HR" [presumably the Liverpool-based florist who wrote the card didn't check how to spell "Wilmslow"!] (2007). One of his competitors, a popular local chip shop, "Blue Fryer", has recently burned down (2003, 2005). Leo takes his GCSEs soon (2036), whereas Nikki is about to sit her "A" levels (2032, 2036). Kylie has a doll called "Jolene" (2038).

Jacqui's address is Flat 2, The Parade, Manor Park (2029). She likes music by Portishead and Massive Attack (2020), opens a "Special Saver" account at Greenfields Building Society (2018), and, according to Ron, has no "O" levels (2016) [ Although this is only because "O" levels had been replaced by GCSEs by 1992 - maybe he is forgetting that she passed six of these!! ]. Mike, whose degree is a B.A. Honours (2031), got her bath oil for Christmas (2003), and she attempts to convince Katie that the one-night-stand - the fictitious "Steven", in his late twenties (2017) - who is the father of her unborn baby, referred to by Rachel as "Charlie" (2030, 2031), had a flat in Cannon Street (2015).

Ron briefly wears a "Greengrocers' Club of Great Britain" tie (2028), turns down a £4 per hour job as a fuel operative (2030), and attends an interview at "Dawn Til Dusk" (2031), where he meets long-lost acquaintance Cliff, who worked with him at Birds Eye from 1976 until 1981 (2031). Ron has worked since he was 15 (2015); his holiday with Molly cost him £500 (1998); and he has bought a selection of games at "Liverpool Palace" (2008). David met Jean in 1955 (2019); he was 53 when he retired (2014); and he discovers that his new residence is going to be Bressingham Hall (2029, 2030). "Brenda's Blooms" have donated the flowers he and Molly win in the "elimination waltz" (2018), and he drinks with Ron at the "Chavasse Bar" (2019).

Marcus, who, like Tom, is a fan of the Beatles (2018), was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment (2004, 2009), and is currently in Kirkham, an open prison near Preston (2014, 2015), having now served 18 years (2022). Hunter & Boyle, Solicitors (2014, 2031, 2035), of Crone Row, Gt Barford, Warrington, Cheshire (2031), write a letter to Eleanor about him which Louise opens (2014), then forward other letters from him to Louise (2031, 2035). According to the web page viewed by Louise and Danny, the movement he was with, "AAV", has been an animal rights group since 1968 (2011); and the newspaper article he has written, of which he sends Louise a copy, is entitled "Cloned In The USA" (2020). Louise has chosen a video called "Secrets and Lies" to watch with Ollie and Eleanor (2020).

Julia accidentally finds a book the Farnhams have obtained: "A Guide to Adoption: The Other Road to Parenthood" by Deborah Fowler (2013). While waiting for Sinbad at the doctor, Carmel glances at a copy of "Country Living" (1999). Tim steals money from a van bearing the telephone numbers 0794 814 814, 370200 and 370207 (2020) to supplement the wages of £35 per week (2017, 2019) that he earns working for Renfrew Building and Garden Supplies (2017, 2020, 2025) in Cape Street (2029). His mate Dibble earns £2.20 per hour stacking shelves (2004); Luke is a trainee gynacologist (2016); and, although Peter met Helen in Zimbabwe, she is from Knotty Ash (2033).

The art by Ansel Adams on display in Eleanor's office is seen again in episodes 2000, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2030 and 2035; a milk float seen in the Close in episode 2009 is from Harrison's Dairies, 27-29 Belmont Road, Liverpool L6 5BG, whose telephone number is 263 4236; the telephone number which appears on Greg's van is 0151 269 5941 (2012, 2014, 2015, 2024, 2025, 2032, 2035, 2038); and deliveries arrive for him in a lorry bearing the name "Beesley and Fildes, Builders' Merchants" and the telephone numbers L'pool 0151 709 9361, Hyton 0151 480 8304, and Prescot 0151 426 0153 (2036).

The notice seen briefly in episode 2027 reads "Manager's Position - We are looking for a bright, enthusiastic person to manage the Manor Park Service Station. If you think you have the experience and dynamism we are looking for, please contact Mr David Crosbie, Manor Park Service Station, Brookside Parade, Manor Park, Liverpool.". A "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Atcham Estate Agents" and the telephone number 0151-692-3216 is outside the bungalow in episodes 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035 and, with an attached "SOLD" banner, episode 2038; and a "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's" and the telephone number 0151 629 1676 is erected outside the Farnhams' in episode 2033, and is still there in episode 2036. Among the houses about which Max has obtained details from the same estate agents in the latter episode is 29 Wakerly Street, Childwall.

Jackie has been given an advertisement reading "Extra Tuition - Extra tuition given to GCSE pupils approaching their exams. 6 years qualified teaching experience. £12 per hour. D. C. Lloyd, 0151 269 4972" (2018). Mick is charged £15 per hour for tuition for Leo from the agency with which Jimmy has signed up (2021), and "Mr Ross" (8/1) and "The Great Pretender" (6/4 on) are the horses which win during the lesson (2022). Katie (2003, 2031), Ollie (2003, 2035), Eleanor (2005, 2027, 2035), Ron (2007, 2009, 2014, 2022), Peter (2008), Dr Cohen (2010), Paula (2015), Kylie (2019, 2038), Leo (2021, 2022, 2027), Rachel (2023), David (2023), Jacqui (2026), and the unnamed woman co-ordinating the "Dawn Til Dusk" interviews (2031) are all right-handed, while Jimmy is left-handed (2005, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2022, 2032).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

From episode 2014, and the file marked "even a blind man on a galloping horse can see what's coming next", Ollie returns home, and finds Louise making a hot chilli stir fry:

Quote:

OLLIE: Can I do anything to help?

LOUISE: No, I can do it.

OLLIE: Erm, look - if this is an attempt to persuade me to let you open that letter, then it won't work. You'll find out soon enough. You don't need to know this minute. Now, I know you're keen to know where Marcus is, but you won't have to wait much longer. When Eleanor gets back from Derby, which is.......

LOUISE: I've opened it.


In episode 2017, while David is seen speaking to Molly on the telephone in the foreground, Ron does a silent commentary, expressing his contempt with mouth movements and associated gestures, in the background.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

It is a typical Spring day on Brookside Parade - Eleanor and Katie are working in the office, and Sinbad is in his shop. New arrivals Greg, Jason and Candy the dog are at the petrol station, filling up their van; and Max is visiting Jacqui's flat as she prepares for a bath, apologising for Susannah's latest crazy ideas about the baby they are paying her to have for them.

Returning home, fireman Ben smells gas, and realises that there must be a leak coming from the flat into which Ron has just moved. He pounds on the door, and eventually a drowsy Ron stumbles across and opens it. Ben rushes in to investigate, and is about to examine the cooker Ron has installed without expert help earlier that day, when he realises that Ron is reaching for the light switch.......

Ben calls out, but he is too late - Ron switches on the light, and there is a massive explosion. Lindsey has just realised that Kylie has run off to Sinbad's shop to collect a doll he has promised her, while she was speaking to Peter at the entrance to the path from the Close to the Parade - and as she hears people screaming, major structural damage arising, and fire alarms going off, she frantically calls out for her daughter.......
