New arrivals the Harrisons eventually decide which house on the Close they want to move into, as the Dixons' Trading Post and a salon open for business on the nearby Brookside Parade. Chrissy spoils Sammy's wedding to Owen by walking out on Frank, while Rod spoils Diana's wedding day by being too busy getting beaten up in a public toilet. His bid to protect rent-boy Craig leads to his suspension from the police, who arrest Graeme for Sue's murder, although not everyone is convinced that they have the right man. And, despite a certain amount of opposition from others, Jimmy makes progress with Jackie, Sinbad makes progress with Marcia, Margaret finally makes real progress with Derek, and Susannah is determined to do her utmost to win back Max.......


The dates:

It is Friday in episode 1007 and, based on earlier and later dialogue, Friday again in episode 1010, in which entries seen in Graeme's diary suggest that events in episodes 960, 987, 988 and 993 all took place on the dates on which all those episodes were originally aired earlier in 1991.

It is a month to Christmas in episode 1023; based on dialogue in episode 1024, it is Friday in episode 1025; and it is December 2nd 1991 in episode 1026.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, except that in episode 1034 there are several interior-only scenes of Patricia arriving for and giving an presentation to an unappreciative audience in London, and in the London hotel room in which she is staying overnight. It is unlikely, however, that these scenes were recorded in London.

Births:

None. Sammy, who is 18 (1006, 1008, 1016), reveals that she is pregnant (1005), and her baby is due at the end of June (1007). Chrissy was 2 years older than Sammy is now when she first became pregnant (1008); it is Terry's birthday in episode 1013; and it is Jimmy's 40th birthday in episode 1018, which is "next week" (1011) / "on Wednesday" (1017) / "the day after tomorrow" (1017) and is also mentioned in episode 1016. We are also told that Tina is over 18 (1011); Ellis is 28, according to Sinbad (1016); the unseen Ken is over 40 (1018); Craig is 13 (1031); and Diana was 10 or 11 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana (1029).

Marriages:

One - Owen George Daniels marries Samantha Louise Rogers in episode 1016, which is three weeks away / November 8th (1008) / "tomorrow" (1015). According to the invitation, not wholly accurate in another respect, it is at 12.30pm on 8th November at Westfield Register Office (1012). Frank and Chrissy married nearly 19 years ago, and had 18 good years (1016). Fran mentions that her cousin is marrying a rich man (1021). Rod and Diana plan to get married in two weeks (1021) / next week (1023, 1024) / at 2.30 at St John's (1024) / on Friday (1026, 1027), but Rod doesn't turn up (1028). We are told that Jackie and Jimmy were married on 2nd December 1971, and that today is their 20th anniversary, in episode 1026.

Deaths:

One - Cyril Dixon is found dead in his kitchen in episode 1038, having had a massive heart attack. Both Sue and Danny died on Friday 4th (1005) / Friday October 4th (1008) / 4th October 1991, according to their coffin-plates (1007); and the following unseen characters who are no longer alive are also mentioned: Ron's mother (1006, 1007), who died 18 years ago (1007); Frank's mother (1010); and Chrissy's mother (1010).

Toilet visits:

Cyril (1006); Ron (1009); Jackie Corkhill (1025); Craig (1026 and 1028); Margaret (1027); Rod and another man (1028); and Frank (1038). Leo discusses with Mick whether his father was "in" or "on" the toilet last night in episode 1013.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Danny Fright, keyboard player (1005); Rain and Pies, musicians (1008); Steve Benson, Windsor Avenue-based bookie (1009); "The Golden Horde", group (1010); Bill, related to Trevor (1010); David, Tina's little brother (1010); Keith's mother (1010, 1019, 1030, 1032); Keith's father (1010, 1032, 1033, 1034); Ken "the chemist" Sumner (1011, 1017, 1018); Sammy's cousin Lisa (1014); Fran's husband, who she cheated on (1014); Diana's mother (1014); Sammy's Auntie Mo and Uncle Jack (1014, 1015, 1016); Mrs Flint, Katie's registration teacher (1017); Diana's mother (1020); Fran's cousin, and the rich man she is marrying (1021); Father Morrison and Father Dart (1021); Karen Mason, who used to do Diana's homework for her (1022); Margaret's father (1023, 1032); Polly Sparrow (1023, 1025); Kenny's sister and her husband (1024); Susannah's father (1025, 1033); Greg, one of Marcia's brothers (1027); Marcia's mother (1027); Fran's mother and father (1033, 1037); Max's parents (1036, 1037); and Margaret's auntie and uncle (1037).

Meadowcroft Park is mentioned again in episodes 1010, 1012, 1017 and 1032, and some of its characters' voices are heard, and part of its closing credits sequence is seen, in episode 1022.

Goofs:

One of the detectives pronounces Martin's surname as "House" (1003).

When seen in close-up, the name on Sue's coffin-plate reads SUSAN SULLIVAN, but when seen not quite so close-up, it reads SUSAN JANE SULLIVAN, and is engraved in a different style! (1007).

Mike proudly shows off his credit card, on which NO name, number or expiry details are printed, in episode 1008.

Mrs Daniels' declaration that "We never had a daughter" in episode 1010 directly contradicts episode 819, in which Owen's sister is mentioned.

In episode 1011, neither Rod's "We've taken out a mortgage out" nor Terry's "I forgived her" sound quite right.

Frank is seen reading a letter in which his surname is "RoDgers" in episode 1010; and although typos in letters from third parties are not uncommon, it is less impressive that Sammy has included the same extra letter when writing her own surname on one of her wedding invitations in episode 1012!

In episodes 1014, 1015 and 1017, and even when he is talking again with Craig in episode 1016, Rod claims that he was offered a CD player, but in episode 996 it was actually a video recorder!

In episode 1015, Chrissy seems to be torn between "So we'll be doing things the way she wants them" and "So we'll be doing things the way she wants us to", as she says "So we'll be doing things the way she wants them to".

DD refers to Diana as "Diane" at one point in episode 1029.

Trivia:

The sign above his hospital bed indicates that Rod, who is right-handed (1012), is a patient of Dr Grey (1029). Both Rod and Craig support Everton (1020, 1027). Freddie lives at number 56 (1020, 1023). Julia doesn't smoke (1024). DD works part-time on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays (1017). Ron, who is right-handed (1038), receives a phone bill for £140 (1008). Mike played footie when he was 12 (1010), his credit agreement is with "Avo Trust" (1018), and he is chased for money by "Ashcroft Finance" (1030, 1038). His new band, "Last", are fourth on the bill for their performance, after "The Pies", "Rain" and "The Grin", but ahead of "The Golden Horde" (a gang of planks, according to Vicky) and Barracuda Dan (1010). Cyril lives/lived in Bevans Lane (1038).

The Farnhams' telephone number is 9443 (1030) / 259 9443 (1038). Patricia, who is right-handed (1037), shops at Tesco's (1035). One of her favourite films is "Splendour In The Grass" (1025). According to Sinbad, who plays "The Mouse Trap Game" in episode 1027, Ellis is 6'2" tall (1016). Sinbad and Marcia are going to a party at the Devonshire (1012), whereas Ellis and Marcia used to go to "Scorpio's" every Saturday (1015). The "For Sale" sign with the name "Binenan Estates" and the telephone number 051 259 9106 is still outside the bungalow (1008, 1011, 1016, 1022, 1023, 1028, 1036, 1038).

John and Barbara Harrison are from Stamford, Lincolnshire (1011); they use "Pickfords" to move (1038), and have "kids" (1013, 1028). Barbara has a degree in history (1013), and is to become the new deputy head of Brookside Comprehensive (1011), whose sign still lists the headmaster as Mr J.W. Woodcock (1017). Frank receives a letter from Pearl Assurance Company Limited, addressing him as RoDgers, regarding a policy taken out the day Sammy, who is right-handed (1012), was christened (1010). At Sammy's wedding, Katie catches the bouquet, and promptly tosses it to Margaret (1016). Sammy and Owen's honeymoon is in Spain (1017), and is paid for by Joan and Trevor, who never had a honeymoon of their own (1010).

Terry receives a letter from Springfield Insurance, Green Chambers regarding Sue's insurance policy number 1234567 (1009). The "For Sale" sign which goes up outside number 9 bears the name "G.Samuels" and the telephone number 051 259 9571 (1019, 1023, 1028). Jack usually goes to the Pacific Star, then sometimes the Labour Club, on Fridays (1008). He has been on social security, receiving £40 per week, for 18 months (1009). Graeme Gordon Curtis lives at 24 Heathville Road (1010). Just before being arrested and charged with murder, he is seen studying entries in his 1991 diary for Monday 1st [July], Monday September 2nd, Wednesday September 4th and Monday September 16th (1010). Detective Sergeant Kent, who arrests him, is single (1005).

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Although they have no dialogue, and are not credited, both Nisha (Sunetra Sarker) and Ronnie (Claire Robinson) return for Sammy's wedding in episode 1016. They can be seen in the background of some of the earlier scenes outside the registry office, then briefly in close-up while Sammy is saying her vows.

The closing credits to "Meadowcroft Park" which can be seen in episode 1022 before Nikki leans over and turns the television off are as follows: Tarquin Tully ADAM DOHERTY - Mrs Tully TRACY DREVER - Tommy Tully SIMON FISHER - Tallulla Tully SINEAD M.

There is a scene involving Mike and Nikki in the Trading Post in episode 1025, which is the ONLY one in which real-life brother and sister Paul and Michelle Byatt ever appear together! And this, from the same episode, must surely be Tommo's finest moment ever:

Quote:

DIANA: When I pick the phone up, nobody's been there.

TOMMO: That's because you've got to wait till it rings before there's someone on the other end.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Unaware that Susannah has joined Max in his hotel room, and is reminding him what she looks like naked, Patricia takes a look out of the living-room window, then goes upstairs to bed. She has just closed her bedroom curtains as 1991 becomes 1992, and the other residents and partygoers begin to come out of the Dixons' house next door into the Close, doing the conga.
