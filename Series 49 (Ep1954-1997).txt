The appearances in "The Lost Weekend" of Damon Grant, Demon Duane, Joey Godden, Simon Howe and Tommy McArdle are in flashbacks from earlier episodes only - of which there are several more, featuring characters who also make new appearances therein.

The Magic Rabbits' music is heard again in episodes 1967 (Tim and Sharon are watching), 1974 (Tim again); 1992 (Kylie) and 1995 (Louise) - although episode 1974 is the only one of these episodes in which the creatures can actually be seen.

After a few credits flashed over the normal closing image of the Close, episode 1993 ends with an alphabetical list of those who "Throughout the year "Brookside" has been brought to you by"......., rolled over images of many of these people waving from the Parade.

The storylines:

Tim's plans to reform his character and join the army are soon dashed, as the O'Learys move to the Close, renting Ron's house with Sinbad, who becomes concerned about his health. Ben moves into a flat with Mike, while Rachel rejoins Katie and Jacqui, as her marriage to Christian memorably ends when he spends too long in the bath. After a third heart attack, Ron resolves to retire, and moves back in with David, who produces a Christmas revue. Meanwhile, Eleanor moves in with Ollie, with whom Danny chooses to stay rather than go away with Bel, and they are soon visited by Eleanor's long-lost daughter, Louise, who is intent on tracking down her real father. Julia decides to learn to drive, Cracker dies, and Elaine goes on the run, leaving Mick to face trial for murder alone - although his ordeal is postponed while efforts are made to locate her. And Lindsey breaks off a brief engagement to Peter after realising, despite Jackie and Jimmy's best endeavours to persuade her otherwise, that the man for her is really Barry, who has returned to help Jacqui rid herself of newly-arrived extortionist Callum - at a price she can only pay by agreeing to be a surrogate mother for Max and Susannah.......

The dates:

It is Friday in episode 1956; it is 17 October 1997, according to a receipt, in episode 1959; and, based on dialogue in episodes 1959 / 1962, it is Monday / Tuesday in episode 1960 [ Rachel says she locked Christian in "on Tuesday" - although maybe she is forgetting, and it was actually Monday! ]. Danny refers to a play he will soon be doing "for November 5th" in episode 1965, and is seen performing it in episode 1968, in which it is "almost the Millennium"; it is November in "The Lost Weekend" and in episode 1976; and based on dialogue in episode 1974, it was Friday in episode 1973. It is 1997 in episode 1978; it is a year ago tomorrow that Little Jimmy died in episode 1979; and it is December in episode 1981. Based on the date on the letter Max begins to write to the Spice Girls Fan Club, it is 10/12/97 in episode 1984; and in the same episode Louise inspects Eleanor's latest - 1997 - diary. Based on dialogue in episode 1986, it is Friday in episode 1988; it is Christmas Eve in episode 1989; and it is Christmas Day in episode 1990. Based on dialogue in episodes 1991 and 1992, it is Boxing Day in the former and 27th December in the latter;and it is New Year's Eve in episode 1993 - until the last few minutes, when it is New Year's Day 1998. It is still New Year's Day, and it is less than a year since the Farnhams' children died, in episode 1994; and, based on dialogue in episodes 1995 and 1996, it is Friday in episode 1997.

Locations:

While most of the action in this season takes place in or near Liverpool, there are quite a few scenes set, although not necessarily recorded, elsewhere. Parts of "The Lost Weekend" occur in Norwich, Basingstoke, and at other points somewhere between these locations and Liverpool; Max is very briefly seen speaking on the telephone to Susannah from the food fair he is attending in Leeds in episode 1974; there are more interior-only scenes at the "Sing Like A Star" studios in Norwich in episode 1982; there are severel scenes taking place in Birmingham, and on the way there and back from Liverpool, in episode 1991; and Ron and Molly are seen a few times in a hotel in Cheshire, somewhere near Knutsford, in episodes 1996 and 1997. It is not clear how far away from Liverpool Mick, Elaine and their children have reached in episode 1954, when they stop and decide on a slight change of plan; and Lindsey and Peter are seen in an airport which may possibly be Manchester, rather than Liverpool, in episode 1968.

Births:

None. It is Ruth's second birthday in episode 1957, and we learn that Louise's birthday is 26th March in episode 1984. In episode 1987, we are reminded that 25th December is Ron's birthday and that Bev had given birth [to Josh] on Christmas morning, and told that they share their birthday with a cousin of David; and Ron then celebrates his 50th birthday on Christmas Day in episode 1990, and again, "a day late" in episode 1991, when he claims to Molly that his cake had "46" candles. We are also told that Joan and Tom are both in their 50s, and Joan had a miscarriage about three years after she married Tom (1979). Ollie says he has experienced parenthood for 20 years - maybe he is rounding to the nearest decade (1995) - and Julia claims, extremely unconvincingly, to be 43 (1969). Danny is 14 (1955); Tim is 16 (1973) / 17 (1975, 1976); William is four months old (TLW); Claire is "nearly a teenager", and was born when Sheila was 44 (TLW); Sheila was pregnant [with Barry] when she was 18 (TLW); Louise is 18 (1976); Ron is "not even 50" (1978); Sinbad is 40 (1990), and "nearly" 20 years older than Leo [no, he isn't!] (1982); and Lindsey is 25 (1984) / over 21 (1987).

Marriages:

None. Robbie, the son of Barry's mate Robbie, is to be married soon (1966), and Peter and Lindsey get engaged in episode 1978, have been engaged for six seeks in episode 1995, but are no longer engaged in episode 1996.

Goofs:

In episode 1980, Jimmy recalls that he and Jackie gave Lindsey and Gary a "good do first time round" at her wedding. Well, Jackie may have done, with her then boyfriend - but Jimmy, living apart from her at the time, wasn't even invited, and could only watch the wedding from a distance!

Also in episode 1980, Susannah's meaning is clear, although her words are garbled: "The expiry date's due up on this."

Sinbad says he is "nearly" 20 years older than Leo in episode 1982. But he is 40, and Leo is still at school.......

Although he surely means "Judy", Ron refers to "Julie" Garland while on stage in episode 1986.

Trivia:

Barry, who used to watch "Coronation Street" (1967), came back from America a year ago (1965). We learn for the first time that he once had sex with Jacqui, who reads a book by John Bowler (1984), when she was much younger (1972) - and that Sinbad saw it happening while doing his window round (TLW). The telephone number of "Bar Brookie" is 274 8196 (1968); and for the last six months, "Barnaby's", another bar by the roundabout on Manor Park Drive, have been paying £1,000 per week (1961) to Callum, whose company logo, "Finnegan Security", can be seen below the sign "Mersey Containers" (TLW, 1975).

Jimmy was kicked out of school at the age of 15 (TLW), and got his first suit at Jacksons the Tailors (1980). Lindsey plans to read "Marie-Claire" (1971), rehearses at "Quay Bank Studios, Norwich" (TLW), and finishes second in "Sing Like A Star" (1983, 1984). Just before being mugged, Peter withdraws £15,000 from a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland (1987). The body of Cracker is washed up at Seaforth Docks (1996). Max and Susannah have been shopping at Boots (1962), and Susannah has also been shopping at Mothercare (1981).

Julia, who has had a hysterectomy (1971), and wins a large bottle of bubbly with pink raffle ticket number 36 (1986), lives in Potterdale Avenue (1961). She nominates Tim, who hates "Neighbours" (1954), and has no GCSEs (1956), for "MerseyMart Hero Of The Week" (1969). David loans Tim a book, "Six Months Among The Gurkhas" (1968), and brings "Gardeners' Weekly" (1970) for Ron to read at the Royal Hospital (1977), to which he is admitted following his third heart attack (1975, 1991). Ron later reads "Country Living" and "The Lady" for research purposes (1987).

Ollie only wears white poppies (1967), and is still a manager at Elton's bookshop (1981). Louise was born in Reading (1974), discovered at the age of 12 that she was adopted (1974), and failed two of her "A" levels (1977). Eleanor, who is on her way to the "MacFadden hearing" (1973), is an only child (1979). Tom likes cricket and photography, and works in the treasurers' department of [Reading?] City Council, and Joan is a staff nurse who likes gardening (1979). Ben was rejected by the Merchant Navy (1972), and spent eight months in Greece before he joined the fire service (1981). Melanie plays a character whose husband is called "Ted" in Danny's play (1968).

Katie is seen reading the "TV Times", from which she discovers that "The Sound Of Music" is not on this year (1991), and Mo used to work in a chippy in Park Road (1993). Josie's father has had more than one stroke (1978). She has remarried and is now living in Newquay, Cornwall (1978), and her new husband is an ex-football player with a coaching and personal training business (1982). Bunty does aerobics three times a week (1957). Molly's late husband, Norman, was a butcher, and the captain of the golf club (1989). Jimmy (1955, 1963, 1995) and Barry (1967), are both left-handed, while Tim (1956), Ron (1958, 1989), Susannah (1966, 1982), Ollie (1971, 1997), Jacqui (1972, 1988, 1992), Max (1982, 1984), Eleanor (1982, 1994), Danny (1994) and Louise (1994) are all right-handed.

Sheila's van bears the logo "Sheila's Flower Shop" and the telephone number 01256 327194, while the telephone number on the door of the "3-2-1 Cabs" taxi Jackie arrives in appears to be 01256 32104 (TLW). The "BLUE" club is in Rawley Street, Birmingham, and its telephone number is 0121 236 7283 (1991); and Jimmy wrecks two attempts to remove a lorry-load of drink from "Magnas Distributors, Wines and Spirits" (1991). The Manic Street Preachers poster on Christian's door (1959), the plaque reading "In loving memory of Sue and Danny Sullivan, who died tragically at this spot 4th October 1991" (1967, TLW), and the art by Ansel Adams in Eleanor's office (1967, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1981) are all briefly seen again.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

The "J" and "L" pages of Max's address/telephone book, which are seen very briefly in episode 1963, list a few people that we have never met, and never will: Linda and George Jackson, Kelly-Marie Jones, Julie James, Francesca Janus, J Jawconski, Colin Linley, and Billy Lloydd.

"The Lost Weekend" features a very brief scene outside Becher's Betting Ltd, at which Jimmy had previously won a bet, and lost a body, in episode 1860!

The end-of-season cliffhangers:

In a "Sons and Daughters"-style multiple-cliffhanger conclusion, this season ends with Ron dropping Molly off at her terraced-house home and sadly concluding that she is a gold-digger.......Eleanor finding that Louise has left because she won't help her to find her real father.......Sinbad revealing to Carmel that he thinks he may have cancer.......Leo returning home to find Mick in tears, as his trial for murder is almost upon him.......Lindsey joining Barry in his hotel room, having finally decided that she wants him instead of Peter.......and Jacqui taking another pregnancy test, discovering that the result is positive - she is having Max's baby!
