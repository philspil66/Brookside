After the opening titles sequence of episode 2039, there is a collection mostly of short reprises from the second half of episode 2038, but also incorporating some previously unseen images. The action then continues from the point at which the previous episode ended.

"Meadowcroft Park" voices and images, including a "Part Two" caption, are heard and seen again in episode 2049, watched on television by Gemma.

While he is looking at the wrecked site of his shop in episode 2058, we briefly see Sinbad imagining it full of firemen in the aftermath of the explosion.

The storylines:

Eco-terrorist Marcus is reunited with long-lost daughter Louise and released from prison, becoming well-placed to tempt his former girlfriend Eleanor away from Ollie, whose job is also under threat. Ron begins to work for Cassie at the petrol station, and Mike starts selling insurance after losing money (not necessarily his) in a film project. Against all the odds, Jimmy lands a job as a teacher - but he might not be teaching Gemma, as Mick is considering sending her away to a private school. Meanwhile, Lindsey is reconciled with Peter, but Gary returns to make things difficult for her again; and the new relief manager of "Bar Brookie", Bruno, soon has his eye on Rachel. Jacqui moves to Chester to prevent even more people from finding out she is pregnant, only to hear that as the birth draws near her deal with the Farnhams may be in jeopardy because Susannah, after remarrying Max, is now pregnant too! There is conflict between Greg and Jason, when Katrina uses some of their money to have an abortion, and the Shadwicks lose their dog in a gas explosion, which also leaves Ben paralysed and drives Sinbad and Carmel apart, even though he is willing to lose his legs to save Kylie's life. Surely things can only get better for Sinbad now.......can't they?

The dates:

It is the Easter holidays in episode 2041; it is 24/04/98, based on Louise's visiting order, in episode 2046; and the VAT return was due six days ago [at the end of April] in episode 2051. Based on dialogue in episode 2052, it is Tuesday in episode 2053 and Wednesday in episode 2054; based on dialogue in episode 2053, it is Friday in episode 2055; and based on dialogue in episode 2057, it is Friday in episode 2058. There is a 1998 calendar on Eleanor's wall in episode 2060; it is June in episode 2061, based on Julia's observation that the salon calendar is still showing May because Peter has forgotten to change it; and, based on dialogue in episode 2062, it is Friday in episode 2064. Based on dialogue in episode 2064, it is Tuesday in episode 2065; Lindsey receives a letter dated 11th June 1998, with an enclosure dated 9th June 1998, in episode 2067; and it is the 90's in episode 2069, when it was apparently "National Car-Free Day" yesterday. Based on dialogue in episode 2070, it is Tuesday in episode 2071; we are "approaching the Millennium" in episode 2072; and it is 1st July in episode 2075. Based on dialogue and images in episodes 2075 and 2076, it must be 2nd July 1998 in the latter episode, and the [football?] World Cup is currently taking place; and it is Tuesday 7th July in episode 2077. Based on dialogue in episode 2077, it is the 21st in episode 2083; based on dialogue in episodes 2081 and 2083, it is Friday in episode 2082. In episode 2081 we belatedly learn that the explosion seen at the end of episode 2038 was on "Good Friday", and from the newspaper article seen very briefly in episode 2082, it was "10th April of this year".

Locations:

The majority of the action in this season takes place in or near Liverpool, although there are some scenes in and/or outside Kirkham Prison, near Preston, in episodes 2042, 2046 and 2049 - and Louise is also briefly seen at a bus stop at an unidentified location in the first of these episodes. There are also scenes in Chester in episodes 2078, 2079, 2081, 2083, 2084, 2088 and 2089 - although those in episodes 2078, 2079, 2081, 2088 and 2089 are only inside Lisa's flat (and, in episode 2081, inside a Chester hospital) - so none of these were necessarily recorded in Chester.


Births:

None. Jacqui is 20 weeks pregnant in episodes 2053 and 2055, and seven months pregnant in episode 2074. Her baby is due in September (2056) / on September 9th (2057) / in ten weeks (2075) / in nine weeks (2079) / in eight weeks (2081) / seven weeks from now (2083) / in six weeks (2085, 2086). Katrina discovers in episode 2065 that she is pregnant by Jason, but has an abortion in episode 2074; and Jessie reveals in episode 2085 that she too once had an abortion, on April 21st 1956.

It would have been Gladys's birthday tomorrow in episode 2075, and her gravestone, seen in episode 2077, reveals that she was born on 30th June 1944. It is Jessie's birthday, which is "tomorrow" in episode 2075, in episode 2076; it is William's birthday in episode 2078; and it is Gemma's birthday in episode 2079. We are told that Louise is 18 in episodes 2043, 2050, 2053, 2063, and that she is "almost 19" in episode 2080; and it is her 19th birthday, which is "this Friday" in episode 2080, in episode 2082 [But see "Goofs" below]. In the same episode it is also Jacqui's birthday, which is "this week" in episode 2081.

Kylie's age varies depending on the source - she is "a six-year-old", according to Jackie, who is maybe rounding up by a few months (2040); she is 7, according to the television news reporter (2041); but mostly she is 5, according to a newspaper (2044), Neil (2046) and Lindsey (2060), who further clarifes in episode 2070 that she was "5 last September". Perhaps the TV reporter's claim is continuing the ongoing trend of the media getting ages wrong - this arises again in episode 2082 when, although we only briefly see the newspaper report of Ron's court appearance on-screen, and no-one reads out this part of it, it says he is "(57)"!

We are also told that Jason is 20 (2044, 2059, 2073, 2074, 2075) / nearly 21 (2080); Tony would now have been 18 (2044); Lindsey is 25 (2051); Marcus is a few years older than Eleanor (2051); Eleanor is 37 (2053); "Ginger" is young enough to be the daughter of the unseen Gerald Martin (2061); George is the same age as Mike (2066); Emily is 14, nearly 15 (2074); the relief manager, later revealed to be Bruno, is in his mid 20's (2074); Katrina is 19 (2074); the new stylist, later revealed to be Pauline, is "40-ish" (2081); Nikki is 18 (2089); and Jacqui is 22 (2089).

Marriages:

One - Having originally been Max Farnham's first wife, Susannah also becomes his fourth wife when she remarries him in episode 2083. Jason says that Greg was already married to Margi by the time he was Jason's current age (2074); we are reminded that Rachel got married last year (2081); and Jessie reveals in episode 2085 that before she married Tommy Shadwick, she got engaged to Tony Fitz at Christmas in 1955, but he died the following spring.

Deaths:

One - Candy, the Shadwicks' dog, is the only victim of the gas explosion in episode 2040. Unseen characters who are no longer alive but are mentioned are: Tim's father (2043); Margi's father (2060); Greg's father (2060) / Jessie's husband Tommy (2078, 2085, 2086); Julia's husband Arthur (2066); Greg's auntie Elsie, who once got drunk on Boxing Day when he was a kid (2081); Tony Fitz, who died at Suez in the spring of 1956 (2085); Marie, a relative of Jessie (2085); and Jessie's Auntie Mary in Glossop (2085). It is 18 months since Matthew and Emily died (2066); it is three years since Beth and Rachel's died (2084, 2086); and Rachel's father died in the same year (2086). It is almost 12 months since Cassie's mother / Gladys died (2068 / 2077); it is the first anniversary of her death on 1st July in episode 2075; and her gravestone, seen in episode 2077, reveals that she died on 1st July 1997.

Toilet visits:

Lindsey (2040); Katie (2044); Gemma (2050 and 2080); Katrina (2073 and 2076); Jacqui (2076 - twice, and 2078); and Eleanor (2086).

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Lauren, a friend of Kylie (2039, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2064, 2069); Lynn / Lauren's mother (2039 / 2039, 2060, 2061, 2069); Davinia, a friend of Nikki (2040, 2041, 2089); Katrina's father (2044, 2065, 2068, 2069, 2070, 2071, 2074, 2085); Demi, another friend of Kylie (2059); and Katrina's mother (2065, 2068, 2069, 2070, 2071, 2073, 2074).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Rebecca Doran, mother of another of Kylie's friends (2039); Tommy Mac, a supplier of Greg (2039, 2076); Steve's "little one" (2040); Gozzy / Gozzy Smith, a mate of Greg who runs a plant hire business (2042 / 2043); Fay, a friend of Emily, and her father (2047); Gerald Martin / Martin / Gerry Martin, general manager (2047, 2049 / 2057, 2058 / 2061); Mrs Gee, a customer of Greg (2050); Miss Spence, Gemma's maths teacher (2050); Gillian, a friend of Gemma (2050); Mr Lewis, Leo's teacher (2051); Degs and Jonesey, friends of Leo (2052); Mr Matthews, a client of Eleanor (2057); Big Davey's brother (2057); Eleanor's father (2058); Shelley, a "Bar Brookie" employee (2059); Gary's mother (2059); Erica Taylor, an posh office worker and old rival of Margi for Greg (2060); Mrs Blake, Kylie's teacher (2062); Bernie, Tim's boss (2063); Katrina's cousins (2063); Lauren's father (2064); Sam, a relative of Katrina (2065); Andrew, a "Grants" employee (2068); Carmel's sister (2069); Karen, a stylist, and her new fella (2072); Mandy, a stylist who is leaving the salon (2077); Reverend Chalmers, who Bruno contacts regarding the ownership of St Christopher's Church Hall across the road (2080); Hayley, a friend of Gemma, and the netball team captain (2082); Debbie, a publicist who split up with Bruno seven and a half months ago (2086); Bruno's brother Hector (2086); Bruno's brother Vance, who was bullied at school and now lives in Wales, calling himself John (2086); Bruno's father (2086); the "Country Squires", a musical act who Jessie invites the Shadwicks to come and see performing at St Anthony's Club (2087); and Joanne, another friend of Nikki (2089).

Goofs:

Lindsey's words are garbled in episode 2047: "I don't not longer I can cope, though".

Marcus adopts a curious use of tense in episode 2049, when he announces his impending departure: "It was time I was leaving".

What should have been Carmel's fifth and sixth words arrive before her third and fourth in episode 2052: "I'm gonna go and have to make myself look presentable".

In episode 2058, Lindsey is seen tearing up into at least three pieces the letter she has received from Gary - but the same letter is intact again, and only a little bit creased, when she shows it to Eleanor in episode 2060.

In episode 2061, Max's fourth and fifth words are the wrong way round: "I'm sure it'll be all okay.", and in episode 2062, he omits "it" before "doesn't": "Even if Jacqui comes back from the cash and carry in the next five minutes doesn't mean the hospital'll have the results.".

Julia reverts just two more times to the pronunciation "Farnham", rather than "Farn-Ham", in episodes 2064 and 2066.

In episode 2069, Jason's sixth, seventh and eighth words are jumbled up - "I'd be lying if I ever said I thought about having kids at my age." - and Katrina replaces "who" with "to", and "to" with "a", to produce possibly the most unintelligible line that any "Brookside" character has ever said: "God help any man to even much as dares a glance at me".

In episode 2077 Mick says, "It's coming up to a year since Gladys died."; and Cassie says, "This time last year, I still had me Mum." But it was 1st July 1998, the first anniversary of Gladys's death, two episodes earlier in episode 2075, and it is now Tuesday 7th July - so they are both wrong!

Jimmy either replaces "that" with "those", or "interviews" with "interview" in episode 2077: "I'll be squelching my way into those interview, won't I?".

It becomes clear in episode 2081 that someone must be forwarding Jimmy's mail to him via the false address he has been using on his job applications, as two rejection letters arrive together at 10 Brookside Close with the rest of the post. But although Lindsey is surprised that they both bear the same wrong address - 26 Harmon Road, she seems to accept Jimmy's suggestion that this is due to a computer error, and doesn't seem to find it at all strange that they still reached him.......

Although we were told in episode 1984 that Louise's birthday is 26th March (she was disappointed not to find it recorded in Eleanor's diary), her birthday arrives on a completely different date in summer in episode 2082.

Jacqui recognises that handwriting on the card reading "To my beautiful pregnant wife, Thank you for making me so happy. All my love xxx" is Max's in episode 2089, even though it does not look at all similar to that in the letter to the "Spice Girls Fan Club" which he was writing when she visited him in episode 1984. [ And Jessie, who initially thinks the flowers are for Margi in episode 2087, must be assuming that the card was written by the florist from which they came, as she would surely recognise that the writing is NOT Greg's! ].

Trivia:

Max, who has had his appendix out (2075), says that the house on the Close was built in 1981 or 1982 (2066). He and Susannah offer to buy another one called "Meadowcroft" (2067), and are waiting to hear the outcome from "Sinclairs" - either the sellers themselves, or their estate agents (2068). Susannah finds a photograph of Max and Patricia which was taken at "Fletcher's"' office party in 1987 (2075), and has been shopping at "Next" and "George Henry Lee" (2085). The number of Lisa's flat in Chester, into which Jacqui moves, is 4B (2079, 2081, 2089).

Margi hears that the "FMWA" want to offer her a job (2078). Greg used to work at Cammell Laird / "Lairds" (2040 / 2060), and receives a fax regarding supplies which is signed by "Steven" (2049). Jessie receives a food mixer, chocolates and a CD set by her favourite singer, "Tom", for her birthday (2076). She watches "Jerry Springer", and is proud of Nikki for taking four "A" levels and being about to be the first Shadwick to do a degree, when she goes off to university in October (2051). Jason, her only grandson (2070), has worked for five years for Greg (2074), supports Everton (2070), has known Katrina, an only child (2070), for less than six months (2059), and has been going out with her for four months (2044) / six months (2070). The tax-disc on Katrina's car expires in March 1999 (2069), and she previously went out with a footballer (2044).

Jimmy studies an advertisement for a history teacher at Manor Park Comprehensive School, Park Road, Liverpool L12, for which the closing date for applictations is May 22nd 1998 (2055), and considers applying to St Hilda's, another local school (2072). He receives two rejection letters, addressed to Mr M.J. Corkhill and Mr Martin James Corkhill, both at 26 Harmon Road, Manor Park, Liverpool (2081); and he reads to William from a book called "Polly The Pigeon" (2069), while Kylie is taking to school with her one called "Do You Know What You Want" (2065). Gary gives Lindsey a letter dated 20th May 1998, reference GS/SC, from Plumbwood Mowrem, Solicitors, of 18-20 Campbell Court, Liverpool 4 8TD, whose telephone number is 0151 228 9188, which correctly shows the postcode L43 6TZ (2058). His statement accompanying Eleanor's letter is on the same letterhead, while Eleanor's shows the address "Unit 2, Brookside Parade, Manor Park" and the somewhat short telephone and fax numbers 0151 292 389 and 0151 845 939 (2067).

Marcus's flat number is 28B (2057), and Eleanor, whose favourite poet is Yeats (2080), goes to see him there after reading a newspaper article headed "ECO-TERRORIST REUNITED WITH DAUGHTER AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS" (2057). After being in prison for eighteen years (2046, 2083, 2084), he is to be interviewed on Radio Merseyside (2062), and has written a book called "A Love Affair Interrupted" (2084). Louise gets him a John Lennon CD for Father's Day (2070), and lends him a book by Mandela that she had obtained from Ollie (2063), who has worked for fourteen years (2072) at Elton's Bookshop in Ball Street (2071), which he hears may be taken over by one of the biggest book-selling corporations, Smith and White (2071). He later hears that the "merger" has gone ahead (2076).

George, who has written a film called "Pushed Out", about a group of Glasgow midwives who are made redundant (2071), went to Brookside Comprehensive (2067) and university (2066) with Mike, who dials "886751" to telephone the Claims Office (2066), and is seen holding a cashcard which bears the names GREENFIELDS BUILDING SOCIETY and MISS J DIXON, the card number 60304, the account number GH689468JUGS and an expiry date of 7/99 - although the lettering looks much darker on the latter appearance (2073 and 2074). Jacqui is then seen in episode 2075 [on 1st July] with statement number 4 for that account, which is dated 29th June 1998, and shows June interest of £147.48 added, direct debits, each of £400.00, on 3rd, 10th, 17th and 24th June, and three withdrawals on 26th, 27th and 28th June. It would seem that Mike had continued to withdraw each day until he then realised Jacqui had that statement, as she is seen in episode 2076 watching him at the cashpoint on CCTV video dated 30/6/98, timed at 6.05 pm.

Sinbad is going to earn £4 per hour for his new job at the chip shop (2089), and is fined £2,000 plus costs (2087) for supplying a gas hose to Ron, who goes to court in a taxi bearing the name "Manor Car Line" and the telephone number 269 6699 (2081). He is fined £3,000, and has also to pay £450 costs (2081); but, based on the financial position he has presented - excluding funds in Jacqui's name! - he has to pay it at the rate of £18 per week (2081, 2082, 2087). A newspaper report on his trial is headed "Tenant fined over shops explosion" (2082). The residents injured in the explosion are all admitted to the "General" hospital (2041); and, according to a television reporter, "at least 20 people were slightly injured" (2041).

Carmel has been shopping at Asda (2055); Mick has a City and Guilds catering qualification (2059); Tim is still working at Renfrew Building and Garden Supplies (2063); Rose has no children (2070); the wording seen on Gladys's gravestone is; "GLADYS CHARLTON 30 JUNE 1944 - 1 JULY 1997. BELOVED MOTHER OF ELAINE AND CASSIE AND GRANDMA OF TANYA" (2077); Karen Dalton is the head of History at Brookside Comprehensive (2078); Jimmy is left-handed (2060, 2063, 2073); and Neil (2045), Louise (2045), Nikki (2046, 2051), Margi (2049), Jacqui (2057, 2067), Rachel (2059), a nurse (2060), Jackie (2063), Tim (2063), Greg (2065), Gary (2067), Ron (2075, 2087), and Max (2077) are all right-handed.

The "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Atcham Estate Agents", a "SOLD" banner, and the telephone number 0151-692-3216 is still outside the bungalow in episode 2041; the "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's" and the telephone number 0151 629 1676 is still outside the Farnhams' in episodes 2045, 2047, 2051, 2053, 2054, 2057, 2061, 2062, and 2063; and it has a "SOLD" sign attached in episodes 2065, 2066, 2075 and 2076. A milk float from "Harrison's Dairies" is seen in the Close in episode 2047, and the telephone number on Greg's van, 0151 269 5941, is seen again in episodes 2044, 2065, and 2081. A skip from "CRS Skip Hire", showing an 0151- number, can be seen in episode 2044; and the recycling bank bearing the name "Cheshire Recycling Ltd" and the telephone number 0151 356 3213 can be seen again in episodes 2056 and 2062. More art by Ansel Adams can be seen on the wall of Eleanor's office in episodes 2067, 2078 and 2079, and in episode 2088 she also has two prints by Claude Monet on display.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

The following words, including an accidentally truncated version of "devastated", are repeated several times over in the newspaper article seen briefly on-screen in episode 2044:

Five year old girl fights for life: Five-year-old Kylie Stanlow was playing just feet from the huge gas explosion that devasted Brookside Parade. The little girl was buried under a mound of rubble, and firemen had to use special camera equipment to find her. Kylie suffered a fractured skull and had to undergo emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from her brain. She is understood to be in a critical condition.

It takes Mike's assumption that a garment bearing the band name "Super Furry Animals" would be suitable for Ron to wear while his own clothes are not available in episode 2045, to finally bring on a line that has probably been lumbering towards us with a certain inevitabilty for years and years: "You are definitely extracting the Michael, Michael.".

Episodes 2064 to 2066 are the last to feature the long-running character Julia Brogan. Memorably, in the first of these, she is seen taking, and failing, her driving test; but, eerily, her lines in the second include "I'm going to miss coming to this house.", and those in the last include "I might have found you a buyer there. Does this mean I get some 'remission'?". The actress Gladys Ambrose died of cancer a few weeks after recording these scenes, on 4th July 1998.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Sometimes the most simple, shock endings can be just as effective as the more convoluted ones....... Sinbad is on his way to the pub, reading the "Echo" as he saunters along the pavement.
