Notes:

These episodes continued not to be shown individually on Channel Four, but only as three-episode omnibus editions, in a new Tuesday late-night slot - never finishing, and sometimes not even starting, before midnight. Warnings as to content were given not only at the beginning of the omnibus editions of 9th September, 14th October, 21st October, 28th October and 4th November 2003, but also before episode 2890 (Part two of the 9th September omnibus), before episode 2912 (part four of the 28th October omnibus), and before the second half of episode 2914 (part three of the 4th November omnibus). Each omnibus began with a "Previously on Brookside" montage before the opening titles sequence, several of which included characters that would not then feature in its first episode: Ali Gordon and Stuart Gordon (2874) / Jimmy Corkhill and Sean Smith (2877) / Katie Rogers, Sophie, and Nic Howard (2883) / Nisha Batra (2886) / Sammy Rogers (2889) / Rachel Dixon (2892) / Marty Murray (2895) / Sean Smith (2901) / Charlie Dawson, Nick Black, Heather Black, Ruth Black, and Little Jimmy Corkhill (2907) / Gard Hampton, Tim O'Leary, and Michaelson (2910) / Suzie Michaelson, Christy Murray, Ali Gordon, Tommo, Jacqui Farnham, Mike Dixon, Bev Dixon, Ron Dixon and Nikki Shadwick (2913).

There are a vast number of "flashbacks" to sequences from earlier episodes in this final season - the last of which, in the closing few minutes of episode 2915, is an extract from episode 370 involving Jimmy Corkhill, Billy Corkhill and Paul Collins. In the cast list above, * denotes that the character appears (or is heard) only within one or more such sequences, and does not otherwise feature in the episode. Also returning for one final appearance, in episode 2910, are the Magic Rabbits, watched by Luke (and Ali and Tommo, while drugged) - and their music is also heard, again as Luke watches, in episode 2913.

Incidental music is featured in episode 2876, in which there are also two lengthy musically-accompanied montages of scenes - the first track used is "Stone" by "Unbelievable Truth", and the second is "Wild Thing" by "The Troggs". Episode 2886 begins with a lengthy montage of scenes musically accompanied by "Tender" by "Blur"; and towards the end of episode 2910, there is a montage of images from Ron and Bev's wedding, Michaelson being beaten up, and drug-taking at the Gordons', accompanied by a piece of rousing opera music. Incidental music is also featured in episodes 2880, 2887, 2888, 2901, 2907, "Unfinished Business", 2913, 2914 and 2915.

Images of Rachel and Beth are briefly seen while Mike is heard in episode 2880; images of Ali and Tommo, then Anthony and Marty, are briefly seen while Jimmy is heard in episode 2907; images of bulldozers are briefly seen while Jimmy is heard in episode 2909; images of Ruth, Sean and Luke are seen while Ron gives his wedding speech in episode 2911; and images of the police outside are seen as Sean is heard in episode 2915.

In episode 2880, the removal of furniture from Rachel's by bailiffs is told as a "flashback" after the event; there are some cross-faded scenes of Katie and Sophie in episode 2886; and dialogue from episodes 2889 and 2890 is heard again, with accompanying flashing effects, in Ali's mind in episodes 2890 (while he is running away) and 2891 (when he is back at home).

Some of Jimmy's words from earlier in the episode echo in Mike's mind later on in episode 2895; we hear some of the "thoughts" of Tim in episode 2902; in episode 2909 we briefly see Jimmy imagining punching Michaelson and stuffing him into the boot of his car, just before his actual encounter with him goes rather less favourably; in "Unfinished Businesss", in which Emily does not otherwise appear, Tim briefly dreams of her, Steve and Tanya, and Steve briefly dreams of himself, Tim and Terry; and in episode 2913 we hear some of Jimmy's "thoughts" as he is driven to Newcastle.

Although the closing music begins as the end of episode 2915 appears to have been reached, it is suddenly aborted, after Jimmy is heard calling "Stop! STOP!".......and more scenes, mostly with a musical accompaniment, follow. The usual "Next" frames in the titles sequence are replaced with a longer series of thirteen still images featuring most of the characters who have appeared in the last three episodes [not, unfortunately, the families who have appeared over the last twenty-one years!] - Michaelson / Marty / Bev and Ron / Jimmy / Ruth and Sean / Nikki and Tim / Ali and Stuart / Steve / Kirsty / Anthony, Marty and Jan / Lindsey and Barry / Barry / Jimmy and Nikki; and one final surprise is that the last note of the closing theme is replaced by the last four notes of the original theme from "Grange Hill".

The storylines:

Mike trains to be a teacher, and Rachel learns to drive - but not even the birth of a son is going to bring them back together. Leanne jilts Christy, but Ron and Bev finally tie the knot. Katie and Nic, finally confirmed to be the father of Sophie, plan to do likewise - as does Lindsey, who returns to the Close with the news that her third husband is to be Barry!

Meanwhile, Jimmy has a brief relationship with Margi; Tim and Steve's continuing adventures lead them to new girlfriends; and Sean splits up with Nikki, sleeps with Sammy, but ends up back with Ruth. Adele goes off to university, and Anthony goes slightly off the rails - but not as much as Ali, who drifts from drink into drugs, and faces an allegation of rape.

But the threat of an incinerator being built nearby remains; the construction of a through road may require the demolition of some of the houses; and the arrival of foul-mouthed, insanely violent drug-dealer Michaelson as a new neighbour proves to be the last straw for the residents. There have been good times, and there have been bad times - but now, nobody wants to live on Brookside Close any more.......

The dates:

Based on dialogue in episode 2882, it is August in episode 2883; it is September in episode 2886 and 2892 [and, by implication, all the other episodes in between!]; and it is Saturday in episode 2893. It is a weekday, then Saturday, in episode 2896; based on dialogue in episodes 2896 and 2897, it is Sunday in episode 2897; and, based on the letter Nikki is seen producing in episode 2899, it is then 30th September 03 - although the date on a torn-up air ticket for Paris seen in episode 2900 suggests otherwise (see "Goofs" below). It is 2003 in episode 2909 and in "Unfinished Business", and it would appear to be Halloween in episode 2912.

Locations:

The majority of the action in this closing season is set in or near Liverpool. However, the majority of "Unfinished Business" is set at a remote farm in Wales, and it also includes some scenes which take place between there and Liverpool; episode 2913 includes several scenes set in or near Newcastle-upon-Tyne (some of which were definitely recorded there), and a few others at an unspecified distance between there and Liverpool; and the closing scenes of episode 2915 are also set in or near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

Births:

There is one final birth, taking the grand total of episodes in which a child was born to fourteen - Rachel gives birth to a son, Michael Dixon, in episode 2911, after being seven months pregnant in episode 2881, and eight months pregnant in episode 2895. It is Stella's sixteenth birthday in episode 2889, and it is Louise's birthday "in a few days" in episode 2898 - Sammy is then seen writing her birthday card in episode 2899, and is heard telling Louise that she is posting her card and present to her in episode 2900 [but see "Goofs" below]. And it is the birthday of the unseen mother of the unseen, but heard, "Chelle", a radio phone-in show caller, in episode 2901.

Kirsty implies that Stuart will be 16 in a few months in episode 2876; Ruth implies that Stuart and Ali are not yet 18, and Kirsty is over 18, in episode 2879; and Ron says Tony would now have been 23 in episode 2895. Adele will be 18 soon (2885); Stella is 16 (2890); Josh is 10 (2893, 2897); Luke is 6 (2898, 2899); Sophie is 3 months old (2886); Ali and Steve are both teenaged (2888, 2910); Ali is a teenager, and not yet 18 (2889); Wills is 6 (2908); Luke is 6 (2910); and Suzie is 14 (2915).

Marriages:

One - episode 2910 is the twenty-fourth in which a wedding takes place, as Ronald William Dixon marries Bev McLoughlin. Although Christy plans to marry Leanne "next week", which is in August (2882), the small matter of the bride running away with a policeman who arrested her on her hen night prevents that one from going ahead (2883); the unseen cousin of Lizzie was also presumably about to marry, as she had her hen night at the club at which Steve was lap-dancing (2875); Barry wants to marry Lindsey, even though Jimmy thought he was already married - but it would appear that he is now divorced, as he replies "I was" (2813); and [maddeningly!], although they are still engaged and making wedding plans whenever they are seen or mentioned, we never ever obtain confirmation of whether Nic and Katie tied the knot! [If Nikki hadn't spent so much time weeping and wailing, and sitting in an armchair, in the final episode, she could so easily have found a moment to pick up and read a postcard from the newly-weds, or Sammy, confirming that all went as planned in Florida.......]

Deaths:

Two, taking the grand total for the series to eighty-eight - including sixteen animals and other creatures. We haven't seen him for a long time, but in episode 2895 Mike reveals that Greg Sinnott was shot dead by drug traffickers in Rotterdam; and Michaelson is hanged in episode 2914. Terry Gibson also dies, impaled on a spike in the unbroadcasted episode "Unfinished Business", and we are reminded that Kirsty's mother died a few weeks ago, and her father died a few months back (2875); it is four years since Greg [Shadwick] died (2903), and it is nine years since Tony died (2911). And several unseen dead characters are mentioned - Mrs Gladys Lloyd / Gladys (2874, 2875 / 2876), who died last week (2874); her husband, who died during the war (2875); her mother (2875); Gordon at the bingo, and the 27-year-old daughter of Brigid's neighbour Mrs Hodge, who both died of leukaemia (2885); Sean's father (2889, 2906); Nic's mother (2900); Jimmy's father (2904) and mother (2904, 2915); Josh's great-grandmother, Ron's mother (2910); and Bev's great-grandfather, who was referred to as "Father" (2911).

Toilet visits:

Stuart (2877, twice in the portaloo - walked in on by Ruth the second time); Kirsty and Ruth (2879, at Jimmy's, after finding that their own toilet has gone missing); Stuart (2879, receiving a round of applause); Rachel (2882); Christy (2884 and 2895); three unnamed women, and Katie (2886); Mike (2894); Luke (2910); Kelly (UB, in a moment of panic in the limousine); and Jimmy (2913, near the "Angel of the North"). Steve steps in dog dirt in episode 2876 - Tim helpfully tries to persuade him that it's lucky - and Ali needs to go to the toilet, but loses the urge, in episode 2879. And the last character ever to go to the toilet in "Brookside", in episode 2914, is.......Jan Murray.

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Candy (2874); Mr Johnson / Hookey (2874 / 2874, 2875); Di / Diane (2874, 2882 / 2884, 2885, 2913); Lizzie (2875, 2891, 2913); Baz (2877, 2878); Jessie (2878, 2901); Old Ray Hilton / Ray (2878 / 2898); Anthea (2880, 2894, 2911); Sinbad (2880); Leanne / Leanne Powell (2882, 2884, 2895, 2896 / 2883, 2885); Leanne's mother (2882); Laura (2883, 2884, 2885); Max / Maxie (2883, 2888, 2894, 2898, 2910, 2911 / 2894, 2910, 2911, 2912); the Pope (2886); Nisha (2887); Clint (2888, 2898, 2911); Debbie (2889); Louise (2889, 2898, 2899, 2900); Tony [Dixon] (2893, 2894, 2859, 2911); Dave [Burns] (2894); [Greg] Sinnott (2895); Dan / Dan Morrisey (2898, 2903 / 2913); Helen (2899, 2906); Snowy (2901); Greg (2901, 2903); Luke Musgrove (2903); Jason (2903, 2915); Susannah Farnham (2903); DD (2905); Kerry (2906); Doreen (2908); Julia Brogan (2910) Gary [Stanlow] (2914); Mick "Johnno" (2915); and Gemma (2915).

And those that are also mentioned, but miss out on their last opportunity of ever being seen:

Abby's mother (2874, 2875); Fay and Amy, mates of Abby (2875); Mrs Brown, who Sean is meant to be fitting an aerial for (2875); Lizzie's cousin (2875); Cathy, Rachel's social worker (2881); Mark Rawlin, a mate of Josh, and his father who works on oil rigs (2881); Norman, a policeman who arrested Leanne, and with whom she fell in love at first sight (2883, 2884); Jean, a mate of Jan in Salford, and her daughter Sian, at university (2883); Laura's mother and father (2884); Mrs Hodge, down Brigid's road (2885); Kev / Kevin (2886 / 2887), one of Katie's past sexual partners; Skimmer, a mate of Ali (2907, 2908); Sean's mother / Luke's nanna (2889, 2900 / 2890); Mrs Dawson, Rachel's next door neighbour (2893, 2894, 2895); Kelly, a single mother, and a new mate of Rachel (2893, 2894, 2895, 2897), and Tania, her daughter (2895, 2897); the wife Christy divorced (2896); Jane from the health club (2898); Nic's father (2898, 2899, 2900); Donna-Marie, Elsie and Brian, Cousin Dorothy and Uncle Pete, all of whom Nic wants to invite to his wedding (2898); Nozza, Bazza, Snouty, Kebble, Crazy Dave, Shane, Rocky, Fish, Captain and Spoggy, Nic's "Red Lion" football team-mates, and Vicky and Tom, the "Ibiza Posse", another bunch that he wants to invite (2898); Richard, Sammy's ex-husband (2900); Joe's ex-wife (2904); Mr Grey from Liverpool General [Hospital] (2906); Lenny, a mate of Ali and Tommo (2907, 2908, 2910); Clare, a mate of Suzie (2909); Ged, a contact of Michaelson (2909); Suzie's mother / Michaelson's ex-wife (2909, 2911, 2914 / 2915); Suzie's uncle Clem (2910); John (2912, 2913, 2915) and Denny (2912, 2913, 2914, 2915), Sean's brothers; Tanya's father and mother (UB); Helen, Kylie's nanny (2913); and Nick, Stuart, Ric, Mal, Vanessa, Sue, Paul and Davie (2915), Sean's impeccable witnesses.

Goofs:

In episode 2874, for most people it would be "a long time" - but for Nikki "It'll be a long way before that happens."; she also uses a strange mix of singular and plural - "Your health and your sanity comes first"; and Tim replaces his fifth word, "of" with a second "as" - "I'm just as sick as being skint as you are".

Ron's handwriting in his note to Mike - "Michael, we'll be out for the day, so grab yourself a microwave meal from the freezer" - seen in episode 2877 is much neater than in notes we have previously seen from him; in episode 2878, the intonation of Jimmy's boasts about his new computer's capability for "Laptop Desktop Publishing" makes it sound like three separate things: "Laptop. Desktop. Publishing."; and, according to Mike in episode 2881, Mandy has reminded him that "she left an abusive husband". Didn't she actually kill him? And viewers can almost certainly remember exactly where she "left" him.......

A Kensington address (see "Trivia" below) appears on Christy's letter from the clinic the first time we see it in episode 2883. But in later reappearances, including a "flashback" in episode 2884, the letter is addressed to him at Marty's address in Brookside Close! And it has previously been established that Louise's birthday is in June, so it is surprising that Sammy says it is "in a few days" in episode 2898, towards the end of September, has only got around to writing her birthday card in episode 2899, on 30th September, and tells Louise that she is posting the card and her present to her in episode 2900 - in early October!

In episode 2900, Jimmy pronounces "Margi" with a soft, rather than a hard "g", again at one point; and the date on a torn-up air ticket that Sean had bought in episode 2899 is 31.08.03, which is inconsistent with the earlier revelation that this episode was set on "30th September 03". And in episode 2901, Nikki's letter from "Merseyside Combined Courts Witness Warning Service" shows her postcode incorrectly as L12 OBE, and includes the wrong surname for one of the robbers - previously "Eddie Wilson", he is now "Edward Heath".

In episode 2905, the dates appearing on the photographs of Margi and Jimmy seen on her mobile phone are not consistent with the timing of her previous visit to Liverpool - which took place towards the end of July 2003, not during May. And in episode 2911, the inclusion of "that" as Jacqui's third word sounds wrong - "We gave that 25k more than the asking price to me dad." - then her own bad memory seems to be letting her down, as she tells Bev: "Perhaps it had too many bad memories for me, like you trying to burn it down with me still in it?". When Bev set it alight (in episode 1825) Jacqui WASN'T in the house!!

In episode 2912, there is confusion about the weight of the baby just born to Rachel - Bev corrects Ron by saying he weighed 3.3 kilos, not 33 kilos, but says this is five and a half pounds in "old money". It's actually more like to seven and a quarter pounds! And in "Unfinished Business", Kelly's credit card statement is dated Thursday 10th September 2003.......but it also says that a minimum payment of £928.36 is required against the balance of £7520.14 by 02/09/03.

In episode 2914, Barry says that "two of the fellas" who killed Damon have been released from prison - but there only ever were two of them! [And were they ever even apprehended?] And finally, in episode 2915, part of one of the short "flashbacks" Marty experiences of his family being held captive (from episode 2759) is the reaction of characters who were being held captive at number 10 at the same time, when they heard the shot - which is surely not something that he would be likely to remember.

Trivia:

The letter dated August 2003 which Christy has received from Mersey Regional Hospital Fertility Clinic in episode 2883 reveals his address to be 27 Baggs Street, Kensington, Liverpool L7 (But see "Goofs" above). His test results are from "J.P. Compulab" (2883). The previously-seen newspaper clipping headed "POLICE IDENTIFY BODY UNDER PATIO" is seen again in episode 2895; and the headline in the edition of the "Manor Park Reporter" seen in episode 2902 is "POLICE KILLERS TRIAL CONTINUES". Josh (2880) and Rachel (2895) are both seen reading "Etoile" magazine; and Sean and Ruth study details of houses from estate agents "Mappin & George" in episode 2908, including Ruth's choice - 14 Tattan Crescent, Childwall. Sean currently lives in Warrington (2903), and his ticket for flight number PA 27841 from Speke, John Lennon Airport to Paris, Charles de Gaulle airport states a baggage allowance of 25kg, a departure time of 06.50 and an arrival time of 07.00 [French time!] (2900).

Nikki is seen taking delivery of flowers brought in a van bearing the name "Efflorescents the Florists" and the telephone number 0151 496 7208, and at Jimmy's computer producing a letter to Steven Fisher, applying for the job of Assistant Psychologist at West View Care Home, Gateshead, in response to a newspaper advertisement also briefly seen on-screen (2899). In episode 2901, she receives a rejection letter which appears to be from "J.J. Pharmaceuticals", and a "Witness Notification Letter" from Merseyside Combined Courts Witness Warning Service, P.O. Box MCC60, Liverpool, whose telephone number [previously Rose Finnegan's - well, she doesn't need it any more!] is 0151 496 0009, regarding the trial date for the case of R. v. Lucas George, Edward Heath and Shane Allan Ladd (See "Goofs" above). The dates on photographs of Margi and Jimmy in a restaurant in Hardman Street seen on a mobile phone in episode 2905 are 14/05/03 and 21/05/03 [see "Goofs" above].

Lindsey gives Jimmy a top bearing the full name of the club she runs - "AWAY THE LARD, HEALTH AND FITNESS CLUB" (2913). Sammy plans to go to "Salome's" (2887), and the doll she wants to give to Katie as a peace offering is "Molly" (2900). Katie plays "Free Me" by "Cast", turning it up to drown out Sophie's cries (2887), and the restaurant at which she and Nic dine is the "Jack Rabbit" (2886). Their DNA test was done at "First Choice Clinic", whose telephone number is 496 5823 (2887) - and, although Nic is an only child (2886), there are twins in his family (2888). Dr O'Shea recommends a late-night pharmacy in Radley Street (2893); as part of a long-winded anecdote, Jimmy refers to an electronics shop in Smithdown Road (2902); and Margi used to go to the "Grafton" every Friday night (2902). Her e-mail address, to which Jimmy almost sends a message in episode 2905, is Margishadwick@ Globalgoss.Com. The school Suzie tells Anthony she is going to sounds like "Grange Park" (2907). Her father spent three years in prison (2908), having been sentenced to three years for possession with intent to supply and 18 months for GBH (2910).

There are posters of Muhammed Ali and Liverpool F.C. on Steve's bedroom wall in episode 2883. Steve passed his driving test at the first attempt, taught to drive by Christy (2895); we are reminded of his and Tim's lap-dancing aliases - "Thor" and "Rough Rider" - in episode 2874; and the wording on his van, "STEVE'S HOME SERVICING - QUALIFIED MECHANIC, COMPETITIVE RATES. TEL. 07700 949 649" is seen again in episodes 2874, 2883, 2888, 2891, 2912 and UB. Steve and Tim's new business is to be called "Wheeler Dealers" (2908), and their flier, seen in "Unfinished Business", reads: WHEELER DEALERS - LIMOUSINE HIRE, VAN HIRE, VIP NIGHTS OUT, AIRPORT COLLECTION, HOUSE CLEARANCES, REMOVALS, LIFTING & SHIFTING - 07700 974 602. Proprietors: Tim O'Leary & Steve Murray". However, their new business partners have convinced them to change the name to "Heels On Wheels" by the end of "Unfinished Business" - when this new name, the words "Limousines for hire", and that telephone number, are seen on a plaque on the wall of their new premises, revealed in episode 2915 to be in "Bank Crest Business Park". Steve is moving to a flat in "Beetham Plaza" (2915).

Tanya and Kelly are working from the "Thirlgate Hotel" (UB). Kelly's "Altus Gold" credit card account number is 1233 211 3327 4267, and her address is 8 Lampont Apartments, Lyster Dock, Liverpool L1 1NY (UB). On the "Liverpool Escorts" website which Terry is seen visiting, there are captioned photographs of "Katy", "Debs" and "Natasha" as well as "Charlie" [Kelly] (UB). In her "A" levels, Adele gets an "A" in History, a "B" in Geography, and a "B" in English, and plans to do a B.A. in English with History at Leeds University (2883). Laura gets two Cs and a D (2883). Abby is already at university, studying "Furniture and Design" (2874). Stella is in Stuart's form class (2887), and lasagne is both his and Ali's favourite meal (2892). The imaginary boyfriend Ruth invents in episode 2900 is "Pete", and the imaginary friend Margi invents in episode 2903 is "Pauline". Ron reads to Josh from a book which appears to be called "The Ruins of Scarcroft Farm" (2893); a book, "Favourite Tales: The Ugly Duckling" can be seen at a window as Rachel leaves in episode 2896; and the book "Amanda's Wedding" by Jenny Colgan is seen in a drawer at the Gordons' in episode 2900.

The milk float seen at the beginning of episode 2915 is from Harrison's Dairies / "HD", of 27-29 Belmont Road, Liverpool, L6 5BG; and a skip seen in episode 2879 bears the telephone number 0151 423 5926. Mike's taxi, bearing the name "County Cars" and the telephone number 0151 496 2222, is seen again in episodes 2879, 2881, 2896 and 2912, and the plate number is 99867 (2896). The door of the classroom in which he teaches for the first time bears the name-plate "Class M5" (2896). There is still art by Sean Scully on display in the bungalow (2887, 2888); the "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's", the telephone number 0151 629 1876, and a "SOLD" banner, is still outside the Farnhams' in episodes 2877, 2879, 2890, 2895, 2906, 2907, 2908, 2909, 2910, 2912, UB, 2913, 2914 and 2915; and a "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Jones, Thomas and Booth" and the telephone number 0151 692 6974 can be seen at the bungalow in episodes 2899, 2903, 2905, 2906, and 2915. Ron (2880), Nic (2887), Nikki (2898, 2899), Katie (2898), Sammy (2899), Sean (2910) are all right-handed, and Mike (2893, 2895), Josh (2910), Jimmy (2910) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Tim's a bit out of practice, and is searching for a suitable compliment when he finds a skimpily-clad Abby polishing a piece of antique furniture in her bedroom in episode 2875: "Nice chest!".

As Ron walks away after saying something he disagrees with at the barbecue in episode 2892, Jimmy saves his fingers by raising the two-pronged implement he happens to be holding at the time.......and in episode 2906, it is possible for viewers to spot that he has accidentally left his iron on the garment he is ironing quite a while before he discovers his mistake himself!

Ruth's finest moment - indeed, possibly the finest moment of any of the Gordons - is her split-second reaction when in episode 2908, with only a few episodes left to go, Sean clinches the "worst joke of the series" prize just after she shows him the details of the house in Childwall that she would like them to move to:

Quote:

RUTH: That's the one I'd get.

SEAN: Who are you calling a one-eyed get?

At the beginning of episode 2912, Michaelson comes out of his house with his hands behind his back, to give the impression that he has been handcuffed by the two policemen accompanying him - then reveals to the watching neighbours that he hasn't, as it was he who called the police to report being beaten up by someone in a Santa costume!

And finally - by a remarkable coincidence, the eight unseen friends Sean mentions towards the beginning of the final episode who are all willing to give him an alibi (Nick, Stuart, Ric, Mal, Vanessa, Sue, Paul and Davie) have the same first names as the eight producers who have been "second in command" throughout the past twenty-one years of "Brookside" to executive producer, Phil Redmond, who wrote the episode.......Nicholas Prosser (Episodes 1-208), Stuart Doughty (257-536), Vanessa Whitburn (649-833), Mal Young (834-1701), Ric Mellis (1702-2067), Sue Sutton Mayo (2077-2286), Paul Marquess (2293-2611) and David Hanson (2612-2915).

The end of "Brookside":

Somehow reflective of the way "Brookside"'s storylines have developed over the years, the first episode had begun with a milkman making his deliveries to a quiet Close, on which nothing much else was happening.......and the final episode begins with the same milkman, making his deliveries twenty-one years later, finding a dead body hanging out of one of the bedroom windows!

By the end of the episode, all the remaining residents have left - the Gordons, the Smiths, the Dixons and the Murrays - leaving Tim, Nikki and Jimmy as the last to go. Jimmy throws his keys on the bonfire in his skip, tells the others "Come on, we've all lives to get on with......." and Tim's limousine drives them away out of the Close.......

.......only to screech to a halt moments later, as Jimmy cries "Stop! STOP!". There is something he forgot to do - something that Marty Murray said. As Nikki delivers the final line of the series - "Jimmy, what is it?" - he gets out, and breaks into each house in turn, plugs up the baths and basins, and leaves all the taps running. Soon there is water everywhere....... He then gets some paint that Marty had told him he had left behind, and paints the letters G A M E and O V E R on the boards covering some of the houses. Finally, using a red marker pen, he adds a "D" to the sign at the entrance to the Close, so that it now reads "BROOKSIDE CLOSED".......

.......Then we see Jimmy at his new home in Newcastle, cutting the grass on a motor-mower as Kylie and Wills play with a frisbee, and Lindsey looks on. Jimmy and Lindsey are then seen hugging - captioned "the end of an era......." - and finally, Jimmy winks at the viewers.
