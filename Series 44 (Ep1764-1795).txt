The Magic Rabbits are seen again in episodes 1772 (watched by Leo and Gemma), 1774 (watched by Louise) and 1775 (watched by Louise again).

A significant proportion of the closing credits of episode 1788 are rolled over the closing images of Patricia Farnham and Eric Brunet slowly wandering through a French vineyard. Eventually, though, the usual image of the Close is faded back in.

This was the last of eight seasons repeated on digital satellite television. Five of these episodes were aired per week on Sky One in the closing months of 2002, in the somewhat less-than-primetime slot of 3.30am.

The storylines:

In this season, there are new vocations for several of the residents. Mick eventually sees what his addiction to steroid-assisted bodybuilding is doing to his family, and becomes a school governor; Jimmy takes on some voluntary work, and plans to cure Little Jimmy of his heroin addiction; David becomes a partner in "Grants"; Katie also gets a new job; and Mike tries to make a documentary about his Bangkok experiences instead of looking for one. Sinbad gets engaged to Val - but also, for a while, to Fee; Sammy leaves the Close again, after being found guilty of wilful neglect when she goes on holiday without making proper arrangements for the care of Louise; and Jean returns briefly with Patricia, who has to face the possible recurrence of her breast cancer. This causes friction between Max and Susannah, who are rebuilding their relationship, and desperately - but unsuccessfully - trying to distance themselves from Nat and Georgia's, as Jules and JC are not satisified when Nat claims that his marriage is over because he is gay. However, when Danny also walks in on his brother and sister having sex, and ends up in hospital, Ollie and Bel finally find out the truth.......

The dates:

As Nat and Jules' wedding was "yesterday", it must be 8th August 1996 in episode 1764; it is Wednesday in episode 1766; and it is the 1990's in episode 1768. Based on dialogue in episode 1771, it was 16th August 1996 in episode 1767 and 23rd August 1996 in episode 1770; and, based on other dialogue in episode 1771, it is Friday in episode 1773 and Wednesday in episode 1772. Unfortunately, other dialogue in episode 1772 strongly suggests that it is also Thursday from time to time in that episode as well! The date of episode 1773 is then revealed as Friday 30th August 1996 from the newspaper article seen and read therein; and, based on related dialogue in that episode, it is 4th September in episode 1775. Based on dialogue in episode 1778, it is Friday in episode 1779.

Locations:

Episode 1789 is first of only four episodes that are set entirely outside the UK, and takes place in the south of France. There are also several scenes at this location in episodes 1788 and 1790, but the rest of the action in this season occurs in or near Liverpool (assuming that it is Liverpool airport in which various characters appear in episodes 1788 and 1793!), with the furthest afield that anyone else is seen being Southport (in episode 1773) and Fornby (in episode 1783).

Births:

None. We are told that Leo is 14 (1766); Louise is 4 (1768, 1773, 1781, 1784); Sinbad is 39 (1772), and will be 40 in a couple of months (1781) / in January (1794); Sammy was 20 when Louise was born (1773); Fee was 14 when her son was born (1773); Danny [Sullivan] would have been 7 today (1776); Josh is nearly 3 (1794); and Nat and Georgia were 14 and 15 in the summer of 1988 (1795).

Marriages:

None. We are told that Nat and Jules married "yesterday" in episode 1664, and have been married "less than a week" in episode 1765; Georgia was married to Martin for six months (1768); and it is three years since the last time Max and Patricia were divorced (1786).

Deaths:

None. Three unseen and never-to-be-seen characters who are no longer alive are mentioned. Tinhead's father is the first of these - although it would seem that Tinhead has given his schoolmates the impression that he is still around, as Leo tells Danny in episode 1767, "My dad told his mum and dad. He told me they went mad."; and Tinhead himself makes an empty threat in episode 1771: "I'll get my dad round to break your dad's neck!". The second is Julia's mother, who she quotes briefly in episode 1790; and the third is one of Nat and Georgia's grandfathers, who they recall died in the summer of 1988 in episode 1795.

Toilet visits:

Jules (1764); Noel (1766); Louise (1768); Gemma (1771); Patricia (1786); Little Jimmy (1789 and 1794); and, in episode 1795, Nat relieves Ron of the speed record he has held since episode 1224 - he enters, he goes, he flushes, and he exits, and all within the space of a mere 16 seconds.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Tinhead's mother (1765, 1767); and Elaine's only kid, who is in Year Nine (1792).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

"Macca" / Kevin MacDonald (1764); Ruth (1766, 1772, 1774, 1776); Josh (1768, 1791, 1794); Dolly Sparrow (1769, 1787); Mandy (1772, 1775, 1777, 1781); Barry Grant (1774); Marianne (1774, 1776); Josie (1775); Trevor Jordache (1776); Beth (1776); Danny [Sullian] (1776); Tony (1779); Gary (1780, 1790, 1791); Martin (1782, 1785, 1786, 1793); David's older brother [Clive] (1785); Rosie Banks (1786); Audrey (1786); Diana (1787); Peter Harrison (1787); and Marcia (1793). David recalls "the Jordache trial" in episodes 1780 and 1785.

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Justin, who Matthew and Emily are staying with (1765); Polly, one of Julia's bingo mates (1769); Fee's son, father and mother (1773); Mrs Harding, who had a perm that went wrong (1776); Mrs Davis, another salon customer (1777); Mrs Gilbert, a salon customer requiring depilation [or "dilapidation", according to Julia!] (1778); Emma, Robert's partner (1779) Roger Barton, a friend of Ollie, and his wife Kath (1783); Fee's cousin and her lad (1783); Jane, lesbian (1786, 1789); Bobby Farmer, a possibly fictitious mate of Jimmy (1787); Maurice, a vineyard-owning painting teacher who has been seeing Jean for a few months (1789); Angela (1791) and Inge in Norway (1793), CB contacts of David.

Goofs:

The letter from Bel which Leo and Tinhead find on one of her disks in episode 1765 was saved on 17/7/96, but it is a reply to a letter she had received dated 11th September.......

In episode 1768, Susannah overemphasises the propriety of the arrangements: "Sammy obviously didn't make proper arrangements for Louise to be looked after properly".

The University franking on the envelope in which Nathan receives his result of his recent exams in episode 1769 is "4-VII-96", suggesting that the letter has taken weeks rather than days to arrive!

The Liverpool Echo article seen a couple of times in episode 1773 is incomplete, and unrelated to its heading "Merseyside mother charged with wilful neglect".

David is excessively fearful in episode 1778: "I'm afraid that may not be very much help to me, Max, I'm afraid.".

Bel is torn between "act as if" and "pretend that" in episode 1781: "Are the two of you going to pretend as if yesterday never happened?"

At one point in episode 1783, Mick calls Susannah "Suzanne".

Trivia:

Ollie was on a hippy commune in 1968 (1795). According to Georgia, he has obtained a book called "A Stranger In The Family" to read up on coming to terms with being the parents of a gay son (1766). JC and Anne honeymooned in Rhyl, and Jules, who spots Nat with Susannah in the "Number Seven Cafe" (1779), was born nine months later (1764). Nat's results are sent to him in an envelope bearing his full address: 9 Brookside Close, Manor Park, Liverpool L43 6TZ (1769). He has just completed his second year of university (1765), but has failed the two most important subjects (1769); and has been having an incestuous relationship with Georgia for six years (1793).

Jacqui is staying in room 101 of the Birmingham hotel at which Katie telephones her in episode 1767, not seeing the note Sammy has left her: "KATIE, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS. GONE ON A LAST MINUTE HOLIDAY WITH NOEL TO TENERIFE. PLEASE WILL YOU LOOK AFTER LOUISE? I'LL EXPLAIN AND MAKE IT UP TO YOU WHEN I GET BACK ON FRIDAY. LOVE SAMMY X". This leads to newspaper headlines "Merseyside mother charged with wilful neglect" (1773), and "HOME-ALONE MUM - VERDICT TODAY" (1785). While preparing for the case, which takes place in court three (1785), Sammy, who earns Â£130 per week including tips (1772), has a book entitled "Taking Your Own Case To Court Or Tribunal" (1779), and David has "A Practical Approach To Criminal Procedure" (1781). He has seen every episode of "Kavanagh" (1779), his radio call sign is still Golf Two Romeo Romeo (1791), and his least favourite colour is yellow (1770).

Max is seen reading "Time Out" (1769), and went to a comprehensive school (1771). Eric is an architect based in Nice (1789). Danny, Leo and Matthew and seen boarding and leaving a number 12 bus going to "Central Bus Station" (1782). Val is a lifelong Liverpool supporter (1793). The girls' Oasis poster, which used to be on the door of their flat, is now on display in the bungalow (1774)! "Tolona" pizza boxes are seen again, this time in Mick's van (1782). Jacqui (1777, 1778), Terry (1785), Susannah (1785), Sinbad (1787) and David (1793) are right-handed, while Jimmy (1767) and Ann Gorman (1771, 1778) are left-handed; and a letter from Bel to her employers which Leo and Tinhead find in episode 1765 on one of her disks, but can't fully understand because it includes "big words", reads as follows:


Your reference: MM/AW/103

Dear Sirs,

With regard to your letter and enclosures of 11th September.

Regarding the allegations of sexual harrassment, outlined in the above correspondence, made against me by Nivens (Fornby), they are not only completely untrue, but also are an outrageous slur against me. They are nothing short of pure invention. This is a clumsy and farcical attempt by Nivens to wriggle out of their obvious wrongful dismissal of me. I look forward to seeing you on Monday and pursuing this matter further.

Yours faithfully,

Beryl Simpson


"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

One of Max's most memorable attempts to change the subject at an awkward moment occurs in episode 1768:

Quote:
OLLIE: How can I put this....Nat feels that he'll probably never be ready for marriage. He's gay.

MAX: He's what??

OLLIE: He told us last night. That's why he couldn't stay with Jules.

SUSANNAH: Oh, er......well, I see. I had no idea.

MAX: I must say, em.......the garden's looking very nice, isn't it, Susannah? Those are pretty - what are they called?

BEL: Pansies.

Cracker's kennel, in which Louise hides in episode 1769, has a number, "10A", above the entrance!

With hindsight, the ONLY clue to the fact later emerging that Max has been having a long-running affair with Faye Spence, wife of Warren, occurs in episode 1778. When David catches Max off-guard by asking for the name of his solicitor, in the hope that he might represent Sammy, Max invents a surname for him instead of giving the real one - "Warren.......Newlove".

There is a misplaced apostrophe on the ballot box seen very briefly in episode 1792: "GOVERNOR'S VOTING SLIPS".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having heard from Georgia and Nat how their incestuous relationship began and continued, Ollie and Bel insist that it must end now. But Georgia tells them it won't - she and Nat are staying together, and nothing is going to split them up.......
