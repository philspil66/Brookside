There is no cast list at all on the closing credits of episodes 537 and 538, in which the normal closing image of the Close quickly fades to the waving cast and crew, over which an alphabetical list of the whole year's team is rolled, followed by the message "Brookside Wishes You A Happy Christmas".

The storylines:

As Christmas approaches, life changes for the residents, and mostly not for the better. The Grants discover that Damon has died, Laura has a tragic accident from which she also looks unlikely to recover, and Billy's attempts to rid the Corkhills of their money worries only lead to Doreen leaving him. Paul and Annabelle briefly gain a spare room, as Mona is sent to a nursing home, but soon Gordon's friend Chris has moved in with them. Terry also has to find somewhere else to live, after Pat leaves for a musical career overseas, but his luck with women doesn't seem to be improving yet. Harry and Ralph pursue some new interests, and new tenants move in, two of whom would still be around nearly sixteen years later.......

The dates:

Episode 501 begins just 10 minutes after episode 500 ends - it is still Saturday, 15th August, which, in episode 509, is three weeks ago. The date on the cheque Harry signs in episode 506 is 1/9/87. It is September 1987 in episode 509, and the war has been over for 42 years. In episode 513, 5th October 1987 is suggested as the date for the barbecue, and it takes place in episode 515. It is Sunday in episode 516, and again in episode 521. It is "Bonnie Night" in episode 524, which is tomorrow in episode 523; and last Sunday was Remembrance Sunday in episode 525. In episode 527 it is Monday afternoon, and in episode 530 it will soon be 1988. In episode 532 it is the first day of December, and in episode 533 it is a year this yeek since Tracy started working at the salon. It is Monday in episode 536, Christmas Eve in episode 537 and Christmas Day in episode 538. A 1987 "Home Planner", covering the second half of the year, can be seen on Jonathan and Laura's wall in episode 513.

Goofs:

Mona's ageing is possibly the strangest of the whole series - she was 82 when first mentioned at the beginning of 1983, but now, nearly five years later, instead of being 87, she is 74 (503).

Annabelle's third and fourth words seem to be in the wrong order in episode 508: "She never sleeps usually to this time".

Mona's trowel hits Ralph a few inches above his right eye in episode 509, but later in the episode he is seen with a plaster a few inches above his left eye !!!

The number "8" on the Collins' front door appears to be upside down in episode 516.

Annabelle uses a word too many in episode 521: "I'll get you a drink for you".

Trivia:

Ten years ago, Paul finished 12th out of 12 when he partnered Jimmy Lincoln in a golfing competition (520). Mona moves into Rosemount (515) Private Nursing Home (516). Gordon, who has known about Chris's 55-year-old friend for a couple of weeks (537), gets an A in French, a C in Economics and a C in Computer Studies in his "A" levels (507). Paul was promoted from a Lieutenant to a Captain when he was 24, at which time Annabelle was still at school (519). He runs the Mersey Marathon in just under 5 hours 20 minutes. Matty finishes in 3 hours 40 minutes (521), having run it four times previously (505, 520) - his best time is 2 hours 53 minutes (505). Matty's gran lived with his family "when we were kids" (519). The social worker who visits Paul and Annabelle wears a CND badge (506).

The police station at which Billy is questioned is in City Road (512). He now reads the Daily Star (523). Rod knew about Father Christmas before he was 8 (535).

Moments later, it returns to the way it has been throughout the rest of the scene!

After Chrissy has seen what a mess they have made of trying to cook the Christmas turkey, and Frank discovers they have broken his collectors' item 78 rpm record, "Baby I'm Gonna Miss You When I'm Gone", Growler, Katie and Sammy all run upstairs and lock themselves in the bathroom out of harm's way.
