The storylines:

While Billy is back in employment surprisingly quickly, Paul is made redundant and decides to find new interests in retirement. Annabelle applies to be a magistrate, Gordon returns home, Harry tries to learn to drive, and Sandra crusades against unnecessary operations. Meanwhile, Heather marries Nick, not yet aware that he appears to be leading a curious double-life. But one event dominates this season, and would long be remembered. On her way home one evening, Sheila Grant is raped - with accusations, regrets, and further tragedy ensuing before the guilty party is brought to justice.

Flashbacks:

Extracts from episodes 366 and 156 are repeated in episode 370, as Paul remembers saying goodbye with Annabelle to Lucy and Barry, and Brian Palmer offering him the job which has just come to an end.

Brief extracts from the siege episodes involving Sandra, Pat, Kate and John are seen and heard in episode 379, as Sandra remembers the traumatic events of the previous year.


"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

Perhaps this is more of a "pause your video recorder and carefully advance the frames" moment, but it is possible to make a positive identification of the rapist by carefully comparing his clothing with what all of the possible suspects are seen wearing earlier on in episode 386. Yes, it really is.......

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Annabelle and Paul believe that, as Gordon has returned home from France in the company of Cecile Malraux, she is his girlfriend and he is no longer gay. However, the 400th episode of "Brookside" ends with them discovering that they are mistaken, as Cecile reveals that he has recently split up from his former lover - her brother, Pierre.
