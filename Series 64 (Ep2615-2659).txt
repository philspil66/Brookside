The Magic Rabbits are seen again - on a widescreen television for the first time! - in episode 2649, watched by Harry and Emma.

There is incidental music in the last segment of the special extended episode 2622 - whose images, in its original Channel Four broadcast, were artificially "filmised" throughout - significantly reducing the realism of the action, and setting an unfortunate precedent for the remaining seasons. It was, however, possible for viewers to see how much better this episode would be without that effect as part of an omnibus edition shown the following weekend.

Four brief scenes towards the end of episode 2655 are all musically accompanied by excerpts from "Apache" by "The Shadows".

Towards the end of episode 2656, as Jimmy walks out of the Close, there are several very brief flashbacks of him doing likewise in episode 2437 - in which he later ended up on the school roof.

Anthony's uncredited appearance in episode 2658 is only on CCTV images of him in the school corridor, in a scene in which he was seen from another angle in episode 2657.

The storylines:

There are a few new arrivals in this season - Dr Gary Parr, his wife Gabby, and Helen Carey - an illegitimate daughter that Ray hasn't seen for nearly forty years. But he loses his mother, as Kitty passes away - and his marriage to Jessie becomes strained, as their home burns down. Luckily, there's room for them at Ron's, as he's spending a few months in prison - while Jacqui spends a few months discovering that being a full-time mother is not for her. But she begins to rebuild a friendship with Katie, and her marriage to Max survives an attempt by Sammy to wreck it. Bev returns, to discover that in her absence Leanne and Christy have completely wrecked her business - and financial problems also continue to affect Rachel and Mike, and cause Nikki to consider dropping out of university. Some of Tim's attempts to make money are more successful than others, while Jimmy's attempts to live without his medication lead to him being re-admitted to hospital, and Diane and Marty's attempts to reduce Anthony's reliance on his religion don't seem to reduce the amount of bullying he has to endure. Can they persuade his school to expel the bullies? And if they do, will this finally solve the problem?

Births:

None. Diane recalls losing a baby a year ago in episode 2627. and Ray recalls standing with Renee on the corner of Green Lane when she told him she was pregnant - with a baby she ultimately never had - shortly before Sylvia, who he was seeing occasionally, also became pregnant (2634) [See "Goofs" below].

It is Josh's birthday in episode 2624; Anthony says it is his birthday on Saturday in episode 2625 [but see "Goofs" below]; it is Beth's birthday in episode 2627; it is Katie's birthday, which is "soon" in episode 2645, in episode 2649, in episode 2648 - and we are told in episode 2649 that she was "26 yesterday". It isn't Ray's birthday in episode 2653, but it is Rachel's birthday - also mentioned in episodes 2655 and 2659 - "next week" in episode 2658.

We are also told that Adele is 16 (2618, 2625, 2645); the never-to-be-seen Richard [Rogers] is older than Max (2620); there is a 19-year age gap between Max and Jacqui (2622); Emma is 2 (2622); Harry is 3 (2622); Louise is 10 (2622, 2625, 2642); Tim is 20 (2626); Anthony is 12 (2631, 2632) / "nearly a teenager" (2644); Wills is 4 (2631); Helen was born in 1961 (2633, 2642); Ray is 68 (2644); Jimmy is 50 (2645, 2651); Stephanie is 12 (2650); Josh is 8 (2651); Steve is 21 (2653); and Mike is "nearly 30" (2657).

Marriages:

None. It is Ray and Jessie's wedding anniversary in episode 2628; we are told that Max and Jacqui have been married for three months (2622 ); and we hear that Sammy and Richard have been married - although not necessarily legally - for five years (2624). Although Ray is never specific about how long he was married to Renee, there are various indications, explained more fully in "Goofs" below, that it was for longer that he has previously suggested.

Deaths:

One - Kitty Hilton dies in episode 2654, following a stroke. Her death was "last week" in episode 2657, and it is her funeral in episode 2658.

Unseen dead characters who are mentioned are Nikki's friend Bernie [Connor]'s father, who died recently (2615); Ray's first wife (2646) / Renee (2619, 2622, 2634, 2635, 2636, 2637, 2638, 2639, 2640, 2641, 2644, 2655), who died two years ago (2655); Tim's father (2628); June Hart (2633) / June (2634, 2644), Helen's adoptive mother (2657), who died last August (2633); Renee's parents (2634); Helen's adoptive father (2639, 2657); Jerome's father (2640, 2649, 2653); "Tommy Mac", Jessie's lover before she married [see "Goofs" below] (2642); Marty's father (2649); Bev's father, who worked in a factory (2653); and Franky, Jimmy's older brother (2658).

Goofs:

Unfortunately, several characters seem to have developed poor memories in this season. In episode 2620, Max tells Sammy that Susannah died on "November 5th" last year - but at the time it was clear that she died on Friday 3rd November. In episode 2625, Anthony claims that his birthday is "not until Saturday"- but, as it was revealed to be on New Year's Eve last year, he means "not until next Monday". In episode 2642, Jessie refers to her former lover as "Tommy Mac" - but in several previous mentions he has always been "Tony Fitz". In episode 2645, Anthony refers to Brigid as "Nan", rather than "Nin", at one point. In episode 2646, Jacqui recalls that it was four years ago that "Bar Brookie" opened - actually it was five years ago, on Valentine's Day 1997! And in episode 2655, George refers to his wife as "Julie" - although, when we previously met her, her name was "Julia" !

It would also appear that Ray was slightly underestimating the length of his marriage to Renee as "thirty-odd" years on the only occasion prior to this season in which he mentioned it, in episode 2378. Based on various - consistent - references to Renee, his affair with Sylvia, and the birth of Helen, throughout the season, it now becomes clear that he was married to his first wife for in excess of 40 years. Poor fellow. Similarly, his recollection of when Renee once briefly became pregnant in episode 2634 indicates that in episode 2364 he also miscalculated the age that child would have then reached if born.

Although there are other clear indications that episodes 2646, 2647, 2648 and 2649 are set on consecutive days, starting with 14th February, Katie's declaration in the last of these episodes that April 5th is "six weeks and two days away" would imply that it is then 21st February rather than 17th February - or maybe she miscalculated too!

In episode 2615, Katie's last word should surely be "deserts" - "Maybe there's a chance that Ron'll get his just deserves."; in episode 2626, the postcode Jimmy gives Jacqui as part of Lindsey's new address in Blaydon is BN32 4QL - but Blaydon is in the Newcastle-upon-Tyne postal region, so its postcode should begin with NE; in episode 2658, Tim replaces "how" with "though": "Seeing as though you're not interested in a partnership, I might get me own van."; and in episode 2659, Diane changes an "A" to an "R": "Oh, he was buzzing when he came in - got picked straight away for the football teRm at Games.".

Trivia:

Katie and Jacqui have been mates "since first year seniors" (2622). In episode 2645, Katie elaborates just a little on what she had seen written on Jacqui's "2002 Year Planner" in episode 2644: "Thursday 4th, Harry's dentist's appointment - Friday 5th, cold-blooded killer released from jail". Jacqui's notes on these dates in April were actually "H - Dentist" and "Dad Home", and are seen again in episodes 2649 and 2659. Louise sings "Tragedy" with Katie, before realising it is inappropriate (2631). The school she has been attending, and to which she won't be returning, is "Ravenspeak" (2626, 2636); and the school Anthony, who is in Year Eight (2655), previously went to was "Rodney Bennett" - evidently not quite as "Blessed" as it used to be (2631). A cartoon in a comic he is seen reading in episode 2632 is "Brain Duane"; Marty gets him a football shirt bearing the name "GERRARD" and the number 17 (2635); and he is made to play in goal for the opposing team - "John Lawson" - enabling one of his schoolmates to kick a ball at him (2646). Brigid came to Liverpool in the 1960's (2631); Steve, who buys a car for £620 (2643), stopped going to mass when he was 9 (2636); the author of the book Diane, then Marty, is seen with in episode 2643 is Louis De Bernieres; and the book Diane is holding when the children all arrive in the bedroom is entitled "DALGLISH: My Autobiography". A book seen in the new kitchen drawer at number 10 is "Sigmund Freud - Introductory Lectures" (2626).

In episode 2642, Nikki receives a letter dated 4th February 2002 from Joel Crawford, assistant manager of Pixel Video, 14-16 Bench Street, Manor Park, Liverpool, informing her that she has had one of their copies of "Bad Cop", hired on 16th January, for at least three weeks now, so she owes them a total of £43.50 in fines. She receives another letter from the same firm, bearing the same date, but from Joe Crawford, in episode 2652. The police station in which she is briefly held is in Blauclair Drive, L1 (2648); Leanne calls for an ambulance from Hayward Road (2652); and the address of Martin Woods, visited by Tim and Emily, is 6 Sheldrake Avenue, Heswall (2628). They have made love in 17 different places (2625), but decide not to add the milk float bearing the insignia "HD" and the name "Harrison's Dairies", on which they hitch a lift (2628). A similar milk float is seen on the Close in episode 2641. Tim finds a magazine in the glove compartment of Christy's van which includes a phone-sex advert consisting of the words "CALL ME NOW: I'M WAITING", the number 0801 789 789, and a topless photograph of Emily (2622), who claims that she put up a kitchen extension when she was 14 (2633).

According to Jessie, Bernard and the unseen Jean now live in Southampton (2658). She and Ray receive a letter from their insurers, "Liverpool Mercantile Insurance", whose telephone number is 0151 496 4960, offering them a settlement of £19,000, which is less than they claimed (2652). Jerome's portion of the claim was for £7,335 (2653), but Jessie is only willing to offer him £700, even though Nikki reveals that she has £20,000 of shares (2655). Ray, who wins £3,024 at the bingo (2622), used to work at the Ford plant in Tuebrook (2633), and once served 30 days of a 56-day sentence in Malaya for wrecking the corporals' mess and fighting with soldiers from his own side (2649). Helen lives at 15 Digmont Road, L9 (2650), recalls her adoptive mother nearly setting the house on fire when she was three (2644), and arranges to meet Ray in the "Black Bull", near Manor Park library (2633) - the same pub involved in Tim's scams (2621, 2622, 2634, 2635). Marty has gone down to the "Harvesters' pub (2659), and "J.R.'s" is mentioned by the policeman as the bar that might be owned by Bev, in an attempt to discover more information that might enable him to track her down and establish Jimmy's identity (2658). According to Jimmy - whose weight, on the scales we see at the beginning of episode 2627, is 13 stone - he had an uncle who was deaf (2659), Jackie hated the rock group "Queen" (2624), and Lindsey's new address is 35 Inglemere Road, Blaydon, Newcastle, BN32 4QL [but see "Goofs" above] (2626).

Lance is now a trainee maitre d' in a hotel off Penny Lane (2645) - through which Tim and Steve are seen driving as they pursue Douggie (2654) - and Nisha is training to be a Nurse Prescriber (2653). Gary is originally from Manchester, but did his medical training in Liverpool (2653). Gabby is a "property consultant" (2658) at Merseyside Regional Marketing Board (2655). Max and George used to play cricket together (2655). The name AESOP-NEEMS and a mobile telephone number ending 570 980 appear of the van of Bev's locksmith (2653); the name HOLFORD & ALLAN and the telephone number 0151 269 2426 appear on the "For Sale" sign erected on "Bev's Bar" (2654); and "Walk-in centre - 0151 496 3157" and "Patricia Wilson - 0151 4964113" are on the "W" page of a personal telephone directory consulted by Sammy (2618), whose husband Richard owns a string of hotels (2622), ran a hotel in the Seychelles with her (2630), and is Polish (2622).

Beth's passbook for her "Special Saver" account with the Merseyside and Widnes Building Society is seen again (2624); so is a "Fletcher's" for sale sign, with the telephone number 0151 629 1876, on the Parade (2619, 2654); as is the address IONA AVENUE, LIVERPOOL L70 4UQ, on the back of another "Mersey Mover" bus (2632). The Richard Diebenkorn art previously seen in one of the flats is now at number 9, Brookside Close (2659); and there are ABBA and Kate Bush posters on Adele's bedroom wall (2638, 2644). Nikki (2615, 2622, 2636), Nisha (2617), Max (2620, 2651, 2655), Ray (2622), Brigid (2622, 2631), Jessie (2622, 2628, 2642), Emily (2622), Becky (2622), Sol (2626, 2629), Leanne (2626), Paige (2628), Anthony (2631), Sammy (2635), Rachel (2637), Gary (2638) and Tim (2641) are all right-handed, whereas Mike (2621) and Christy (2627) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 2622, we briefly see on-screen a topless photograph of Emily in an advertisement Tim finds in one of Christy's magazines - but his thumb is covering her bare breasts!

In episode 2624, Ron mentions another prisoner who has just been released - "Fairhurst", a low-life who stole his phonecard. There must be a possibility that this was Harvey Fairhurst, suspected of the rape of Nikki Shadwick a couple of years earlier.......

In episode 2626, it becomes clear that Leanne has watched the Channel Four series "Big Brother", as she does a passable impression of the show's Geordie commentator, Marcus Bentley: "Christy and Leanne have failed this week's task. They have only £483 to spend on booze.".

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Steve comes home to find that Marty is out at the pub, but Diane has had good news - Anthony has got on well at school for once. He was picked straight away at Games, and other lads thanked him for getting rid of Imelda - apparently they were also relieved that she had been excluded. Steve wonders why the school doesn't just kick her out now - but Diane assures him that they are planning to do just that. From what has been said, Imelda will be coming back for a few days while they work through their procedures, then she will be excluded permanently - so hopefully this whole nightmare will finally be over for the Murrays.......
