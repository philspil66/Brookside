The Magic Rabbits reappear in episodes 544 and 549, watched on television by Gordon.

There is no cast list at all, or writer indicated, on the closing credits of episodes 539 and 540, in which the normal closing image of the Close quickly fades to the waving cast and crew, over which an alphabetical list of the whole year's team is rolled, followed by the message "Brookside Wishes You A Happy New Year".

Episode 561, excluding its final scene, was included on the video release "Brookside: That Man Harry Cross", and episode 576, excluding its final scene, was included on "Brookside: The Sheila Grant Years".

The storylines:

Tracy and Jamie take a trip to London, which at least temporarily reduces the problem of overcrowding at number 10. Jonathan goes on holiday on Austria with Terry to try to cheer himself up after Laura dies, and comes home to problems at work. Frank has even more problems at work, as Chrissy's insistence that he tries to better himself only leads to him facing a disciplinary hearing. Ralph builds a model of the Close and, with Harry, becomes involved with the running of the Commonwealth and Empire Club, and after various things have driven them further and further apart, Bobby walks out on Sheila for good. Paul is finding it increasingly hard to cope with Gordon's relationship with Chris - even though they rescue Mona from a corrupt nursing home - and Annabelle is becoming frustrated with his attitude. Will theirs, the last surviving marriage of all the original residents of the Close, be the next one to run into difficulties?

The dates:

It is winter in episode 543, in which Jonathan plans to go on holiday at the end of March - which he does in episodes 563 to 566. It is mentioned in episode 546 that Bobby will be appearing in court in "early February", and he does in episode 551. In episode 559, Sheila recalls that it was Armistice Day, when there was a bomb in Enniskillen, about a week before Damon died. It is Sunday in episode 553, 1988 in episodes 558 and 562, and 22nd March 1988 in episode 564. In episode 570 it is Sunday again, and a year ago that Bobby and Sheila were in Rome. In episode 573 Bobby receives a letter dated 23rd April 1988 from the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, and in episode 583 the date of Betty's protest is the next Monday, 6th June. This protest is seen taking place in episode 585.

Jimmy describes his father-in-law, Jackie's father, as a "miserable auld get" who is loaded but ill (568 ) - he takes a turn for the worse in episode 570, and dies in episode 571.

Toilet visits:

Frank - specifically for a "sit down job" (539); Harry (544); Gordon, with help (once in 553, twice in 554 and once in 555); Jamie (559); Kathy (560); Arthur (564); and Jeff (573). Jimmy nearly goes in episode 563, but has to answer the telephone instead.

Goofs:

At one point in episode 543, Paul pronounces "Sonia" as if it rhymes with "begonia".

[With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps unfortunate that Sheila tells Barry in episode 557 "You're Bobby Grant's son all right".]

At one point in episode 580, Sizzler says "No splits" WITHOUT stuttering!! Also in this episode, it seems strange that, when speaking about her brother, Betty calls him "Arthur Parkinson" rather than just "Arthur".
