Although he does not reappear at all later in the extended episode 1826, Little Jimmy Corkhill (GEORGE CHRISTOPHER) is among the characters featured in a 60-second framed montage of pre-credits reprises from earlier episodes preceding that episode.

The closing credits of episode 1830 are replaced by an alphabetical list of who "Throughout the Year 'Brookside' was brought to you by"........, rolled over images of many of these people waving from the Parade.

Ron Dixon's absence from episode 1838 brings to an end an unbroken run of 42 consecutive episodes in which he has appeared - a record, but one which will soon be broken.......

A new, sixth, opening sequence, which includes "Bar Brookie" and some cyclists, replaces the long-running previous version from episode 1851 onwards.

Unusually, scenes towards the end of episode 1864 in which Ollie throws a table through a mirror are shown in slow-motion - although the same technique is employed again only seven episodes later, during the Farnhams' car crash.

The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard again in Georgia's flat in episode 1866, although the creatures are not seen. As other voices can be heard in the background, she is possibly watching them on television while listening to something else on the radio.

The storylines:

As "Brookside" enters its gloomiest year, this season begins with a house burning down, and ends with a horrific car crash. In between, the burial of Little Jimmy requires more than one coffin, family therapy sessions seem more likely to split up Bel and Ollie than Nat and Georgia, and Mick and Elaine have to bring their wedding forward because Gladys is diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mother who isn't dead after all, a father who is a murderer, and escalating debts are all too much for Terry, who disappears from the Close forever; and Jack also does a permanent runner, rather than face the consequences of his actions. While Katie hopes to try again with Christian, he seems to have his eye on Rachel; while Mike gets closer to having his book published, Lindsey has had enough of him; and Jackie decides against a future with Ron and returns to Jimmy, with whom she becomes pregnant again! Jacqui adds "Bar Brookie" to her expanding empire, while David is keen to take over at the petrol station, and the "Trading Post" is forced to move upmarket. And after all their problems seem finally to be behind them, Max and Susannah are looking forward to happier times ahead - but their worst nightmare may be just about to begin.......

The dates:

It is "nearly Christmas" in episode 1826; it is Christmas Eve in episode 1827; and it is Christmas Day / 1996 in episode 1828. It is Boxing Day in episode 1829; and it is Hogmanay / New Year's Eve, the last day of a leap year, in episode 1830 - until the last minute or so, after the chimes of midnight are heard. It is January, and Friday, in episode 1838; it is the 22nd in episode 1840 (according to a desk calendar), when "Burns Night" is on Saturday; and, based on dialogue in episode 1842, it was Friday in episode 1841. It is the 90's in episode 1845; based on dialogue in episode 1846, it is Friday in episode 1847; and it is Valentine's Day, which is "next week" (1846) / "tomorrow" (1849), in episode 1850. Based on dialogue in episode 1852, it was also Friday in episode 1850; and, based on dialogue in episode 1860, it was Friday again in episode 1859, and it will be Friday yet again in episode 1862. Based on dialogue in episode 1862, it was Thursday in episode 1861; it is Spring 1997 in episode 1865; and, based on dialogue in episode 1866, it is Wednesday in episode 1870. Based on dialogue in episode 1867, it is Friday in episode 1868; it is April Fools' Day in episode 1869; and, less precisely, Jimmy claims in episode 1852 that it is exactly five years since he and Jackie got together again.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, apart from several London-based scenes in episode 1838, including a few both inside and outside a cafe called "The Lunch Box".

Births:

None. Georgia is 12 weeks pregnant by Nat in episode 1827, but has an abortion in episode 1830. Jackie is expecting a baby in July (1863, 1866), and is "four months pregnant" (1863) / "five months gone" (1870). Tinhead claims that it is his mother's birthday in episode 1855; and it is Mick's birthday, which is "tomorrow" in episode 1859, in episode 1860. We are also told that Cassie was a baby in the 50's (1829); Tanya is 15 (1829); Georgia is 23 (1832); Rachel is 18 in March (1839) / nearly 18 (1844, 1845) / not yet 18 (1846) / 17 (1848); Sinbad is 40 in a few days / on Sunday (1841); Christian is 21 (1850); Little Jimmy was 21 when he died, according to Bel (1853), and the same age as Nat, according to Ollie (1862); Dolly Sparrow was 42 in 1973 (1854); Gladys is in her 50's (1856); Danny is 14 (1857, 1864, 1867); Matthew is 11 (1857); Jackie is 43 (1863); and Henry Fraser was the same age as Jimmy (1863).

Marriages:

One - Mick Johnson marries Elaine Davies in episode 1870, which is "a couple of months" away (1848, 1851), "at Easter" (1848) and "two o'clock, a week on Wednesday" (1866). Julia married Arthur "soon after the war" (1832) and "40-odd years ago" (1848); and, although she gets engaged to Jack in episode 1831, and they plan to wed "four weeks on Friday" (1839) / in "four weeks" (1839, 1840) / in "two weeks" (1843) / "next Friday" (1848) / in "one week" (1849), that's another of those weddings that never happens! Jackie and Jimmy have been married for "20-odd" years (1841), and have been together "20 years" (1838, 1840), a figure which may be taking into account occasions that they have been estranged since they married - and in the latter episode, Jackie remembers something Jimmy did on her mother's silver wedding! Bel and Ollie have been married for 24 years (1864, 1865).

Deaths:

None. Beth died "about 18 months ago" (1838), and Little Jimmy died "three months ago", according to Bel (1853) / 12 weeks ago (1855). Unseen characters mentioned who are no longer alive are Gladys's husband Charles / Elaine's father (1829, 1835, 1870 / 1871), who died of a heart attack about three years ago (1829); Harry Fraser (1834, 1836) / Henry Fraser (1843, 1849, 1851, 1855, 1862, 1865, 1867, 1869); Julia's husband Arthur (1848, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871), who died 24 years ago (1869); Gladys's grandfather (1854); and Georgia's grandfather / Ollie's father (1856 / 1858, 1863).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Jeremy and Lavinia, friends of Susannah who had their wedding reception at Manor Lodge Hotel (1826); Dolly's husband (1827); Carla, from Leo's year, who he hoped was Elaine's daughter (1829); Margo and Keith, who are always the last [?] to arrive and the last to leave parties at the Simpsons' (1830); Amy Walton, a friend of Julia (1832); Maurice, French friend of Jean (1832); Mr Kennedy, a teacher of Tania (1833); Diane, a petrol station worker (1835); Aggie, another friend of Julia (1836); Sharon's father (1838); Bri, a boss/colleague of Jimmy in London (1838); Jackie's mother (1840); Steve's father, Steve's sisters Julie and Ann, and four of their five children [the other one appears in episode 1835!] (1840); Joe / Elaine's ex-husband (1842, 1871 / 1852); Mick's mother (1846); PC Coban's mother (1847); Tessa, Karen, Barbara and, Debbie, "Trading Post" job applicants (1847); Mr Rawlins, Matthew's games master (1851); Andy, "Bar Brookie" chef (1853, 1854); Denise, part-time supervisor at "Grants" (1853); Dr Swanson, consultant (1854); Steve the commis-chef, who had a vasectomy (1855); Frank, JC's solicitor (1856); Duncan, Katie's dance "boss" (1856); Mr Tarlatan, an over-55 (1856); Charlie Chung on the corner of Roscommon Street (1856); Kitty and Elvis, in Gladys's ramblings (1858); Dolly Sparrow's husband, and their twelve children (1859); Laura, who Susannah is having lunch with (1860); Mr Brenner, an over-55 (1860); and the "Sparrow Girls" (1869), other than Dolly (Polly, presumably).

Goofs:

Detective Inspector Summerfield omits the word "of" in episode 1826: "And you thought a way to fix it, didn't you?".

Ron is torn between "have" and "get her" in episode 1827: "I did have her some bits and pieces.".

In episode 1830, as they await all their party guests, Bel expresses surprise that Margo and Keith, always "last to arrive, last to leave" aren't there yet.......so surely she means "first to arrive, last to leave"?

Not for the first time, Mick refers to "Suzanne" Farnham in episode 1841.

Nat is trying too hard in episode 1842: "I'm trying my best to try and move on"; and, in the same episode, Elaine hears her mother's number incredibly quickly - less than four seconds after she has dialled 1471!!

Bel adds an extra word in episode 1852: "You'd do AS well to remember that".

Trivia:

Mick had his appendix out when he was about 10 (1856), and is assured that Jenny will be remaining in prison for at least another six months (1871). He and Elaine, like others before them, buy rings at David M. Robinson, jewellers (1853), and marry at St Mark's church (1866). Gladys is in a hospital near Emperor Street (1863). Her late husband, Charles, was from Nigeria (1829). Tanya is in Year Nine (1865), which is the same year as Danny and Leo (1830). She wins prizes for French and Design & Tech. (1865), and Danny gets the Maths, Science, I.T. and the overall year prize (1865). Ollie helped to set up a publishing company in the 60's (1831); Bel tries to promote mail-order organic farm produce from "Freedom Meadow" (1851, 1868), based in Worcestershire (1853); and Nat and Georgia, who have been having an affair for six years (1837), get into a taxi bearing the name "Maple Cars" (1866), discover that JC has had their belongings dumped into a skip bearing the name "CRS" and the telephone number 4242397 (1868), and plan to move into a flat in Beechwood House, Liverpool 16, whose details they obtain from Alderken Property Management Services, 14 Warebank Road, Liverpool L16 0TW (1869). The O'Learys have a cat (1858). Matthew is an Evertonian (1859) who once joined the Cubs, but got bored after a week (1851).

The first pub Sinbad ever drunk in was "The Sailor's Tavern" (1842). He unsuccessfully tries the code numbers 3697 and 3796 to switch off the burglar alarm in his shop (1850). Among the library books Jackie has borrowed are "Painting - A Complete Guide" by Kenneth Jameson (1865). She was in Gracie Market when she went into labour with Little Jimmy (1852), and her mother received stolen candlesticks from Jimmy for her silver wedding (1840). His interview in the "Guardian" is headed "The Class Divide and Drug Abuse" (1871), and the letter he receives from the coroner's office bears the postcode L43 6TZ (1859). When Jack is out, Julia thinks he may be at the "Green Lion" (1865). She and her late husband, Arthur, used to go to the "Grafton" every Saturday (1870). Ron post-dates the cheque he writes for Sinbad "15th January 2000" (1837). His account is with the Royal Northern Bank (1837), as is Terry's, whose very similar cheque book is seen in episode 1843. It is "nearly 30 years" since Terry's mother allegedly died (1834, 1836) / "over 30 years ago" that she walked out (1839), and he was three when he last saw her (1843). Dolly Sparrow, whose husband had a vasectomy after they had 12 children (1859), was 42 when she began the menopause in 1973 (1854).

The sign giving full details of JC's company: "J.C. Bradley (Construction) Ltd, Domestic, Commercial and Industrial Specialists, 0151 692 3109" is seen again in episodes 1831, 1834, 1837, 1840, 1842, 1843, 1844 and 1846, whereas other signs, showing just the company name, can be seen in episodes 1839, 1841, 1845 and 1847. The telephone number of the pizza parlour, 0151 269 2434, can be seen on its van again in episodes 1833, 1839, 1846 and 1852; "Tolona" boxes are seen again in episode 1839; and a "Fletchers" sign can be seen again in the distance in episode 1855. In episode 1842, David notices that Ron has taken Bev's name off the "Trading Post", and in episode 1871, "Manor Park Delicatessen - International Foods" is added to its window. Meanwhile, "Jacqueline Dixon" is the name installed above the door of "Bar Brookie" in episode 1867.

When fire forces the residents to temporarily seek refuge elsewhere, they stay at the "Manor Lodge" B&B, on one of whose walls there is a promotional poster for the show "Daisy Pulls It Off" (1826). A "For Sale" sign bearing the estate agents' name "Haskayne Brimstage" and the telephone number 0151 269 4000, is still outside number 10 in episodes 1826, 1827, 1833, 1836 and 1837, with an attached "SOLD" banner. "My Son", which Jimmy backs at odds of 14/1 at "Bechers Betting", beats other horses including "New Inn", "Grocer's Folly", "Cittadino" and "Green Apples" in the 2.30 at Cheltenham (1860). Yet another pile-up in Queens Drive - evidently an accident black-spot - is reported by a radio newsreader in the background in episode 1870. Mike (1838, 1859), Nat (1838), and Jimmy (1840, 1843, 1845) are left-handed (1840), while Bel (1835, 1861), Jackie (1835, 1840, 1869), Ollie (1835), Cassie (1838), Terry (1839), Jacqui (1846, 1851, 1858, 1869), Georgia (1846), Sinbad (1855, 1870), Ron (1860, 1865, 1868), Julia (1860), and Mick (1861) are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Although episode 1825 ends with Ron discovering that "Casa Bevron" is on fire, episode 1826 begins with some additional scenes which take place BEFORE this happens. The concluding scenes of episode 1825 are then reprised a few minutes into episode 1826. And, as studies have apparently shown that men typically strike matches "towards" themselves and women strike them "away from" themselves, the "strike action" of the arsonist seen in one of those additional scenes is possibly an early clue that they are female, and therefore not Jimmy!

Among other letters headed "LOTTERY FOLLY", "PATHETIC OFFER" and "GIVE US A CALL", on the "Voice of Merseyside" letters page of the "Echo" briefly seen in episode 1855 is the following letter, headed "Cruelty of coroner's rules to murder family":

I am writing on behalf of a local couple, Jimmy and Jackie Corkhill, who, because of bureaucrats at the coroner's court, have not been able to mourn the death of their son, even though he has been dead three months. Surely any person with an ounce of compassion would put this poor family out of its misery and allow them to bury their only son. For once, could people's feelings be put before the rules of the pen-pushers at the City Hall.

Cassie Charlton.


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Driving home in the rain after a day out at the fire station with Matthew and Emily, Susannah is frustrated as the children bicker in the back seat. Each of them - first Emily, then Matthew - try to get away from the other by climbing over into the front passenger seat. Susannah angrily tells them to sit back down, adding, "Oh, for God's sake, if you don't shut up, I'll kill the pair of you!". Momentarily distracted, she doesn't see another car cutting across the road to turn right in front of them. Still standing up, Matthew does, and he and Emily both scream. Although Susannah manages to brake, the road is slippery - and they crash with considerable force into the back of the other car.......
