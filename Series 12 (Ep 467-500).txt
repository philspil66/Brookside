Liam and Jayne Byatt's older brother, Paul Byatt, would later play Mike Dixon.

The storylines:

This season includes a long-remembered dramatic sequence, in which Billy reaches the end of his tether and drives maniacally over all his neighbours' lawns in frustration; and a moment of visual comedy almost unrivalled in the whole twenty-one years of the series, as Harry accidentally puts a hammer through his toilet bowl. A vast amount of time is devoted to new arrivals Jonathan and Laura, and the seemingly endless preparations for their wedding, while Paul and Annabelle receive early indications of the problems of having someone elderly and not always lucid living with them, Bobby begins to deal with his first AIDS case at work, Damon tries to impress his new girlfriend Debbie's father, Vicki walks out on Terry, and Pat tries to embark on a career in music. Meanwhile, the Corkhills sink deeper into debt and, faced with the prospect of losing the house, Billy decides the time has come for drastic action.......

The dates:

It is Tuesday in episode 470, "bank holiday weekend" in episode 471 and Tuesday 12th May next week in episode 472. It is "nowhere near Christmas" in episode 475, Tuesday afternoon in episode 480, and Midsummer night tomorrow in episode 486. It is the last day of June in episode 488, in which Annabelle has known Rod for just under two years, and Friday tomorrow in episode 489. It is a year ago that Sheila was raped in episode 490, and Saturday afternoon in episode 492. It is summer in episode 493, when Debbie has known Damon for "a couple of months", and the Corkhills' repossession is due to take place on September 8th in episode 494, which is "a month off" in episode 496. In episode 497, Billy's "job" is "a week on Saturday", the same day as the first match of the season, and the same day as Jonathan and Laura's rescheduled wedding, which is postponed for three weeks in episode 492. The wedding is originally 2 weeks away in episode 486 and twelve days away in episode 489, and the new date - 15th August, according to episode 489 - is 21 days (and nights!) away in episode 492, three weeks away in episode 493, and "next week" / "in a week" in episode 498. Bobby arranges for Stan and Mrs Higgins to visit "a week on Sunday" in episode 498.

Goofs:

Billy's words seem to be in the wrong order in episode 469: "A good bit of news".

Bobby calls the priest "Gibbon" rather than "Gibbons" in episode 469.

Damon misses out the word "than" in episode 473: "....more sense to be led on".

Annabelle refers to "treading on eggs" in episode 476 - maybe she means eggshells?

Vicky says "for" instead of "to" in episode 476: "I've wanted to say that for you for months".

Billy uses one word too many, or not enough, in episode 477: "I'll see if I can get you some jumble sale".

Jonathan probably means "play" when he says "If I plan my cards right......." in episode 498.
