The "Magic Rabbits" are seen again in episode 325, and their tune is heard again as Terry watches television in episode 331.

An alphabetical list of who "Brookside has been brought to you throughout the year by" follows the usual cast list in the closing credits of episode 330, which roll over a different, brighter view of the Close. Towards the end, the cast and crew are faded in, waving.

Unusually, the closing music begins well before the end of the dialogue in the final scenes of episodes 333 and 343.

The storylines:

Things are looking up for Sandra, as she receives a promotion, and for Pat and Terry, who begin to make a success of their van-hire business after some initial difficulties. Ralph, after encouraging Harry to move on by placing a personal ad, appears to have found a new companion; and so has Heather, although she is having a tougher time at work. Karen adapts to university life, but Damon's YTS scheme comes to an end, and the course Sheila is taking seems to be leading her to interfere in other people's affairs, including Matty's. Annabelle and Paul battle to extricate Lucy from a doomed relationship, only for her to apparently embark on another one; and when Tracy sleeps with, and Billy deals with, a teacher at her school, he avoids a prison sentence, but loses his job.......

The dates:

The only references to specific dates areas follows: in episode 329 Christmas Eve is tomorrow, and James's visit to the Collins' is set for January 6th - it takes place in episode 333. In episode 330 it is Christmas Eve, and in episode 332 it is New Year's Eve, then New Year's Day. Nick is unable to present the cheque Heather has given him early in the new year in episode 334 because she has dated it 1985 instead of 1986. In episode 335 it is a Monday night in mid-January 1986. It is Monday again in episodes 339 and 341, and Wednesday both tomorrow and today in episode 342. It emerges in court in episode 349 that Billy's attack on Montague, seen in episode 342, took place at 4.50 pm on Tuesday February 4th. In episode 356 it is "nearly April", in episode 357 it is a bank holiday, and in episode 358 it is April 1st. In episode 362 Harry reflects, reading an unseen plaque in Torquay, that it is 42 years since 6th June 1944.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, except that Harry, Ralph, Madge, Julia and Damon are seen travelling by train to Devon in episode 361, then in a variety of locations in Torquay throughout episodes 361 and 362. Although Damon is seen calling Rod in episode 366 from a phone box "not far from Chelsea's ground", nothing else but a wall appears in the background, so it is unlikely that these short sequences were actually recorded there.

Births:

None. It is mentioned that Tracy is 15 (322, 342, 345, 346); Damon is 17 (325), then 18 (361); Emily is 3 (346); Harry is now 67 (348), and Billy is 39 (349). It is Claire's first birthday "tomorrow" in episode 333, and she celebrates it in episode 334. Sally Dinsdale's children are 11 and 9 (353); It is Bobby's 49th birthday in episode 355. Ralph is "60-odd", and younger than Harry (358).

Marriages:

None. We are reminded, however, that Bobby and Sheila have been married for 27 years (341).

Deaths:

One - Marilyn the rat begins a long tradition of unlucky creatures who don't manage to stay alive for long when they appear on the Close, as Barry Grant shoots her dead in episode 340. We are also told that Bobby's father has been dead for years (353), and Billy's mother is also dead (331). So is Madge's husband Desmond (358), and Tommy Cagliorani, a Yank she knew during the war (362).

Toilet visits:

Sinbad (328), two schoolboys (337), Harry (351), Madge (351), Bobby and George - together (364), and Guy (365). The horse pulling the holidaymakers round Torquay in a cart also does its "business" on the way - but Harry refuses to let Julia scoop it up to use as manure (361).

Characters not seen yet, but there's just a chance that they may be coming along later:

Nick's two older children - Jasmine, who prefers to be called Ruth (334, 341, 350, 360), and Scott (334, 341); Jimmy's wife Jackie and their kids (347); and Sally's husband (364).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Tom Curzon (321, 322, 331, 337, 363); Howard Drucker (322, 332, 333, 337); Jessica (323, 362), David Hargreaves (325, 326, 329, 331, 349, 351); Margaret (328); Kate (328, 330, 355); Roger (331, 348); McArdle (335, 338); Janice (336); Marie Jackson (336); Camilla (339); Sonia (347, 363); Janet Hanson (355); Kevin (362); Greg (364); George Jackson (365); Brian Palmer (366); and Gordon (366).

Goofs:

Pat in episode 323: "If Terry hasn't.......doesn't have any luck......."

At one point in episode 332, Harry refers to the "Empire and Commonwealth Club" instead of the "Commonwealth and Empire Club".

Although Keith Tench has apparently contributed an article to "Accountancy", the picture seen of him in episode 350 has clearly been superimposed on a feature actually credited to Sean Franklin and Tony Hall.

Ralph in episode 354: "I pay rou rent for living here"

Sheila in episode 362: "Why are you acting like this for?"

Hamilton & Devereux is referred to as "the company" - which it can't be - by Keith Tench in episode 365.

William John Corkhill stands accused of attacking Peter Neil Montague (349). Doreen failed her 'O' levels (340). Tracy is in class 4N (344). She is seen with a book "Manual of Public Relations" by Pat Bowman and Nigel Ellis, which, presumably, she has just been using to lean on (322)!

"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

How Annabelle ever managed to find anyone in her address/phone book is a mystery - in episode 336 it can be seen that Tom Swift (312 19742), Alan James, 14 South Break Street, and Lucy's work number are all listed on the same page!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Doreen has been out on a shopping spree after Billy has won his appeal in court - but returns to hear bad news: "I wasn't out celebrating last night. I just couldn't face coming home, that's all. That fella yesterday didn't want to see me about the Llandudno trip. He sacked me. No redundancy pay, nothing - sacked. No more income, no money, nothing.......
