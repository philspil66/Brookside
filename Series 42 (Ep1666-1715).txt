The Magic Rabbits appear again, this time watched by Kylie, in episode 1680; and their music is briefly heard in episode 1693, while Eddie is flicking through a few different television channels.

The storylines:

Although orange dye proves to be a vital ingredient in the creation of one of the funniest episodes in twenty-one years of "Brookside", the first few months of 1996 certainly are troubled times for the residents of the Close. Katie loses confidence in herself, and needs to be treated for bulimia; Jacqui loses a boyfriend, as Shane dies after overdosing on uncut heroin; and Mike and Lindsey look likely to lose their freedom, arrested in Thailand for drug-smuggling after a jealous Gary gives Kylie a teddy that is stuffed in more ways than one. Jackie leaves Jimmy, after bullets are fired through their window; Sinbad realises he has no future with Mandy, and has to be persuaded to return baby Ruth to her after a visit; Max and Patricia look set to part, after Max accidentally gets himself an undeserved reputation as a kerb-crawler; David returns alone from his travels with Jean, and realises that they no longer want any of the same things; and Sammy leaves Owen and returns to the Close, probably after visiting a few pubs on the way. And Eddie and Rosie try to rebuild their marriage, after Rosie's addiction to gambling leads Eddie to want a future with his daughter-in-law instead - but they may be about to lose their home, unless perhaps Rosie can make a shrewd investment with the compensation money they receive for her hospital treatment.......

The dates:

It is Boxing Day in episode 1666; and, based on dialogue in episodes 1667 and 1668, and the date appearing on Mike's poster in the former episode, it is 28th December 1995 in the former and 29th December 1995 in the latter. It is a leap year in episode 1671; and it is a Friday in episode 1674. Based on dialogue relating to Sinbad's birthday, it is Friday 19th January in episode 1677, and it is Friday 26th January in episode 1680. "Valentine's Night beckons", according to Max, in episode 1686, and it is Valentine's Day / Valentine's Night in episode 1688. It is Pancake Tuesday in episode 1690; and, as the pancake races were "yesterday" in episode 1691, it must then be Wednesday. Based on dialogue in episodes 1690, 1692 and 1695, it is/was Tuesday in episode 1693 and it is Wednesday in episode 1694; and, based on the magazine feature seen and read in episode 1692, it is 1996. There is a March 1996 calendar on Bev's wall in episode 1696; and it is March 13th 1996 in episode 1700, based on dialogue in episode 1712. It is still March in episode 1704; it is Friday in episode 1707; and it is Good Friday in episode 1710. Based on dialogue in episode 1706, it is 10th April (which is "next week" in episode 1708) in episode 1712; and based on dialogue in episode 1714, it was Friday in episode 1713.

Locations:

Most of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, the only exceptions being a few scenes in Manchester airport in episodes 1694 and 1711, and several scenes in Bangkok airport, Thailand - NOT actually filmed there! - in episodes 1695, 1696 and 1697.

Births:

None. Mick thinks that it is Sinbad's 39th birthday on Friday in episode 1675, and throws him a party on Friday 19th in episode 1677, at which Sinbad reveals that it's actually the next Friday - the 26th, which arrives in episode 1680. It is Rosie's birthday, which is "soon" in episode 1689, in episode 1698; it is Mick's 38th birthday in episode 1699; and it is Rachel's 17th birthday, which is "on Friday" in episode 1705 - in episode 1707. We are also told that Shane was 24 when he died (1683); Lindsey is 23 (1668); Jacqui is 19 / not over 21 / "16" according to a newspaper! (1673 / 1687 / 1690); Tony would have been 17 now (1679), having died when he was 14 (1683, and according to his gravestone, seen in episode 1689); Sinbad will be 40 next January / next year (1687 / 1707); Gemma is 8 (1687); Ruth is 4 months old / 6 months old (1689 / 1701); Frank was 47 when he died (1700); Kylie is 3 (1702, 1704); and Mark is 29 (1707). Less specifically, there is nearly 20 years of an age difference between Eddie and Sarah, and between Ron and Bev (1675); Katie is at least 3 years older than Lee (1676); Max is in his "mid thirties" (1700); and Julia's friend Dolly [Sparrow} is an Aries, like Rachel (1707). Unseen motorist John Heaton is 37 (1686).

Marriages:

None. Eddie and Rosie have been married for 22 years (1674) / 23 years (1683). Jackie and Jimmy have been married for 23 years off and on (1674) / 20-odd years (1675) / 23 years (1679, 1680). Lindsey implies in episode 1693 that she has been married for five years to Gary, whose unseen mother and father are divorced (1677).

Deaths:

Two - Jackie discovers that Polly the cat was unable to withstand a hail of bullets through the window of number 10 in episode 1680; and Shane Cochrane dies of an overdose of uncut heroin in episode 1682. Tony died on 7th February 1994, according to his gravestone, and two years ago this week, in episode 1689; and Katie's father died two and a half years ago in episode 1700. Unseen characters mentioned who are no longer alive are: Winnie Howard, an old friend of Julia who committed suicide (1673); Winnie's husband, who had died some time previously (1673); Jimmy's mother (1691); Jimmy's father (1687); and Mark's younger sister Meg, who starved herself to death (1703).

Toilet visits:

Mike (1666); Bev (1673 and 1696); Julia (1673 - explaining that she needs to go every 20 minutes in the winter!); Kylie (1690 and 1694); Jimmy (1711); and Gary (1713). According to Jackie, Lindsey has had the runs for two weeks (1709); and, although Terry (1676), Katie (1677) and Mike (1685) also claim that they are going to the toilet, they appear to be using this merely as an excuse to be somewhere else.

Mentioned, so far unseen, but just possibly going to be glimpsed later: Tom, DD's boyfriend (1710, 1711).

Goofs:

In episode 1690, Mike says that he and Lindsey are due to fly "a week on Wednesday" - which should surely be "a week tomorrow", because later on in the very same conversation he says they are going "in eight days' time".

In the same episode, there are contradictory indications of the order in which the three pancake races are run: Ron says that "We're gonna start with the ladies, then the fellas, and finally the kids", but when starting the men's race, Julia says, "Now to see who's going to join Jacqui and Gemma in the grand finale" - so the children's race has been run before the men's!

Trivia:

Patricia is right-handed (1708), and so is Max (1702, 1708). He appears on Radio City 1594 AM, which is based in Stanley Street (1693), and encounters Linda on the way there in Wemmick Street (1693), in which he is later accused of kerb-crawling (1712). A newspaper article seen regarding this matter is entitled "AWARD-WINNING RESTAURANTEUR ARRESTED FOR SOLICITING" (1703, 1705), while "Grants Restaurant Wins 'Mersey Nite Out' Award" is the more positive headline on the feature from that publication which is seen in episode 1692, revealing its 1996 choice. The obnoxious diner who Max mistakenly thinks is their representative is right-handed (1692), and so is PC Ian Coban (1697, 1704). Max is defended by Warren Spence [whose wife he has been seeing for quite a while, it will later emerge!!] who may well be from Bell, Mapson, Spence & Company, Solicitors, the firm that Eddie and Rosie consult regarding their case against the hospital (1706), which is settled out-of-court for £25,000 (1714).

Ron is right-handed (1692, 1701, 1711). His shop, The "Trading Post", is renamed "Bev's Trading Post" in episode 1671. He reads a book called "Herr Benny" [?] in episode 1673, and another called "Not To Be Scoffed At", by Ann-Marie Sapsted, in episode 1692, to understand more about Katie's bulimia. She is right-handed (1689, 1697, 1710), and her mother leaves in episode 1675 for Japan, where she is going to teach English as a foreign language (1673). Jacqui, who pretends to be "Mrs Kennedy" to order a taxi (1686), and asks Katie to get a top from Top Shop for Rachel's birthday (1705), is also right-handed (1669). Shane is left-handed (1669, 1671) and comes from Dubbo, New South Wales (1672). He played the character "Greg Brady" (1672, 1675, 1677, 1678, 1679, 1671, 1672, 1674), who was killed by a harpoon (1673) in the soap "Sunset Bay" (1669, 1672, 1677, 1678, 1682). His death is reported in the "Daily Star" with the headline "SMACK AND THE BEANSTALK - Panto Star's Last Performance" (1683), and the later article for which Jacqui is paid £5,000 (1689, 1690) is entitled "SHANE'S SMACK HELL - Scouse Sweetheart Reveals All" (1690).

Mike, who is left-handed (1686), reveals that he failed his driving test for the fourth time in the week before Christmas (1667). His fifth test is "next week" in episode 1686, and he takes - and passes! - it in episode 1688. His friend Keith is now working in Ankara, Turkey (1678), but loses his job after taking time off (1686). Lindsey is right-handed (1690), and Geography was her best subject at school (1695). Gary is right handed (1686, 1704), and left school ten years ago (1675). Lee did domestic science for a year (1676), and Bev came last in Maths (1671). Helen is a marine biologist (1688, 1692) who Terry met in Florida (1688). Mark Smith is a clinical psychologist (1697), and is right-handed (1700). He is also a manic Tranmere supporter known as the "Prenton Parrot", and editor-in-chief of a fanzine about the club, of which he gives Katie a copy (1700). Big Davey's height is 5'2" (1679), and Jimmy's favourite soup is chicken (1711).

Tony's gravestone, seen in episode 1689, reads as follows: "OUR DEARLY BELOVED SON AND BROTHER ANTHONY DIXON, TRAGICALLY TAKEN FROM US 7TH FEBRUARY 1994 AGED 14 YEARS. THE LORD BLESS THEE AND MAKE HIS FACE SHINE UPON THEE". A van bearing a logo "Pestilim Ltd" and the telephone number 0151 269 0815, sent to Korky Kars by Jacqui, is seen in episode 1686. Part of the "Gift Box" telephone number - 3626 - is seen again on Mick's van in episode 1685, and he is seen carrying another box of pizza bases bearing the brand name "Tolona" in episode 1699. According to a radio report heard in the background in episode 1676, "Bamson and Son" started ten years ago with a small business plan, making luxury recycled paper; and, according to another radio report heard in the background in episode 1686, there has been a pile-up in Queens Drive [not for the first time!].

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Jacqui's yellow-and-black car, seen in episodes 1671, 1674, 1681, 1682, 1683 and 1704, has the number plate YKA 168W.......which has previously made occasional guest appearances on the vehicle normally wearing AWA 40X!

Mike's poster, seen very briefly on-screen in episode 1667, reads as follows:

MIKE DIXON-S VIDEO SERVICES. Enhance your child's chances of being chosen for the forthcoming advert to be shot in Liverpool. Starts 9am 29th December 1995, 8 Brookside Close, Liverpool. Telephone 269 3826, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Terry tries to persuade Rosie to change her mind, but she is convinced that she is going to win. Eddie frantically battles his way through the crowds in the casino, but he is too late. The whole of the £25,000 compensation they have won from the hospital has been staked, and the roulette wheel is already spinning.......
