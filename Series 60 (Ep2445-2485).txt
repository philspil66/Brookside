Episode 2445 (M 06-11-00 "Jacqui") Written by John Fay - Susannah's first visitor makes her an offer - she wants to buy back her baby, who was never officially adopted, and for whom Susannah has proved herself to be an unfit mother.

Episode 2448 (W 08-11-00 "Emily") Written by Peter Cox - Susannah's fourth visitor learns that there isn't going to be a wedding after all.

For that, she deserves to die!

Episode 2449 (F 10-11-00 "Max") Written by Patrea Smallacombe - Susannah's fifth visitor regrets everything he has ever done to hurt her. He knows that although she is no longer going to marry another man, he has let her down so many times in the past, and there is now no way that she is ever going to marry him for a third time either.

Notes:

The previous season ended with the mysterious, unexplained death of Susannah Morrisey - and press releases made it clear in advance that this season would begin with a week of special episodes in which viewers would be travelling back in time to earlier, previously unseen events from the evening of her death. It was also revealed in advance that it would emerge in these episodes that Susannah had been visited during that evening by five of her neighbours, and that by the end of the week we would discover at whose hands she died.

However, the circumstances of Susannah's death would remain a closely-guarded secret at which viewers could only guess until - in an ingenious twist - the end of the FOURTH episode. Although episodes 2445 to 2449 all begin in a similar way, with a selection of the same images that originally aired at the end of episode 2444 (slightly extended in the first two, revealing that a broken mobile phone is also among the objects in the living-room at number 7, and truncated in the other three), only the first four are followed by flashbacks to the previously unseen past, and in the fifth the action continues on into the future from the point at which Susannah dies.

As well as the "death" sequence mentioned above, scenes involving Susannah, Katrina, Harry and Emma originally seen earlier in episode 2444 are also repeated in episode 2445. However, all of these characters also feature in new material later on in that episode. Some scenes from episode 2465 are also repeated in a flashback sequence near the beginning of episode 2466, slightly distorted in places, as Tim remembers the car crash of the previous night.

In episode 2449, images of a dead Susannah at home are flashed while photographs are being taken on the Parade. During episode 2450, there are three occasions in which Jimmy's words are heard, echoing somewhat, while Max is seen elsewhere - words that might well reflect what Max may be thinking; and in the second of these there are some quick cross-fades as he walks towards number 7. At the beginning of episode 2452, there are two instances of images of number 7 appearing while Max scolds Leanne in his flat for sending Lance there instead of going herself; and, later in the same episode, some of Ron's dialogue is heard echoing as a woman resembling Susannah is serving herself at the petrol station. At the beginning of episode 2457, images of Mick, Max, and Jacqui/Robbie, all in different beds, are seen while Nikki is speaking to Jerome; and towards the beginning of episode 2474, Diane is seen on the parade, on her way to donate a pram to "Trina's Tots", while Marty and Anthony talk about her at home. There are a couple of incredibly rapid camera pans in episodes 2477 and 2484, and there are several cross-fades of Shelley at points at which she loses the plot in episodes 2484 and 2485.

For scheduling reasons, eight episodes (2447 and 2448 / 2456 and 2457 / 2460 and 2461 / 2469 and 2470) were originally broadcast on Channel Four edited into four double-length omnibuses, each in a 60-minute time-slot. The opening moments of Episode 2448 - an edited reprise of the conclusion of episode 2444 - were deleted from this broadcast, but remained in the omnibus edition of episodes 2448 and 2449 shown on Sunday 12th November 2000. Similarly, the reprises at the beginnings of episodes 2446 and 2447 were not included in the omnibus edition of episodes 2445, 2446 and 2447 which aired on Saturday 11th November 2000.

The track "Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad" by "Moby" musically accompanies both a selection of short dialogue-free scenes of Max, Lindsey, and Jackie at the beginning of episode 2454 [after which it continues to play, more quietly, on Shelley's radio!] and a further selection of scenes, this time involving only Max and Susannah, in episode 2455.

Additionally, Susannah (2445-2449, 2461, 2465), Lisa (2447, 2448, 2461, 2465) and Daphne (2448) are played by younger stand-ins in images of them from the year 1969, seen on a videotape that is being played in these episodes. The images of the young Susannah in episodes 2445 and 2446 are, however, only reprises of those originally seen in episode 2444.

Susannah's voice in episode 2451, and her appearance in episode 2455, are extracts from episode 2448, as the evening of her death is remembered; Kitty's appearance in episode 2474 is only on a videotape that is briefly played; and Jacqui's voice is heard only in a message left on Max's answering machine in episode 2476.

With her appearance as a magistrate, Ann Aris becomes the first female performer to be credited in a fourth different "Brookside" role.

Episode 2469 has a credited cast of 30 perfomers - the third largest of the whole series.

The storylines:

Susannah is eventually laid to rest in peace, although some of her last visitors are sorrier to see her dead than others. Max is particularly regretful over things he might have done differently - but Jacqui promises she'll be there for him, even though this bothers her new boyfriend, Robbie. Bev also loses a major part of her life when the fiance formerly known as Dave scarpers, taking £25,000 of her fortune with him. Katie continues to go out with Clint, Steve continues to go out with Katrina, and Mick sleeps with Vonnie - but she's not convinced that she wants to repeat the experience. Jessie marries Ray, Emily vows to stand by Tim as he begins a prison sentence, and Jerome continues to see Nikki - but he also begins to drift in the direction of Nisha. Diane becomes pregnant, but loses the baby - not necessarily due to the power of Anthony's prayers - and Mike is involved in a car accident which leaves him hospitalised, and possibly permanently crippled. And when Jimmy is finally discharged from his mental ward, the only way that Jackie and Lindsey can prevent him from finding out that Shelley has convinced herself she is in love with Jackie, and is making increasingly desperate attempts to persuade her that the feeling is mutual, is to unite and send her packing. But Lindsey is more prepared to believe Shelley's claims than Jackie's denials - will the relationship between mother and daughter ever be the same again?

The dates:

The whole of episodes 2445 to 2448 and the first half of episode 2449 take place on the evening of the same Friday as episode 2444, with occasional revelations of how the time is progressing. It had already been revealed in episode 2444 that Susannah lay dead at 9.22pm, and the action in episode 2445 begins at 6.58pm, according to her carriage-clock. When she inserts a videotape into the video recorder in episode 2447, its clock shows 20:37; when one of her earlier visitors returns at the end of part one of episode 2448, the carriage-clock shows that it is 9.10pm; and Max is seen looking at his watch, which shows that it is now 10.05pm, early in episode 2449. Dialogue later on in that episode reveals that it is now the following day, Saturday, and it is still Saturday throughout episode 2450 and the first half of episode 2451. For the rest of episode 2451, and the whole of episodes 2452 and 2453, it is the day after - Sunday; and dialogue in episode 2454 reveals that this episode takes place on the day after that - Monday.

There are year planners for 2000 on the walls of the Murrays' in episodes 2447, 2463 and 2468, and the surgery in episode 2451, and Lindsey claims in episode 2449 that she has been seeing Shelley for six months, since June [although maths may not be her strong point]. It is "a couple of weeks" after the Friday and Saturday of episodes 2444 to 2451 in episodes 2456 and 2457; and, based on dialogue in episodes 2455 and 2458, it is Monday in episode 2457 and Tuesday in episode 2458. Based on dialogue in, and a document seen on-screen in episode 2466, it is Tuesday 19th December 2000, then the early hours of Wednesday 20th December 2000, in episode 2465, and it is Wednesday 20th December 2000 in episode 2466. Although this document also suggests that some of the events of episode 2468 take place on Thursday 21st December, it is clear from other dialogue in episode 2468, and another document seen on-screen therein, that it is then Wednesday 27th December 2000 - and dialogue in episode 2477 clarifies the inconsistency to some extent [See "Trivia" below for explanation]. It is New Year's Eve in episodes 2469 and 2470, then it is New Year's Day 2001 in the last few minutes of episode 2470; it is still New Year's Day in episode 2471; and it is 2nd January in episode 2472. Based on dialogue in episodes 2472 and 2473, it is Tuesday in episodes 2474 and 2475; and based on dialogue in episode 2458, it is 26th January in episode 2482.

Locations:

All the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, apart from some scenes involving Bev and Dave which take place in and around a hotel in Chester - not necessarily recorded there - in episode 2482.

Births:

None. Diane confirms that she is pregnant in episode 2451, after trying for six years (2450). Her baby is due on 5th July (2463) / in July (2464), but we discover in episode 2471 that this is no longer to be. It is Jerome's 21st birthday in episode 2455, which is being prepared for in episode 2454; it is Jackie's 47th birthday in episode 2458; it is Anthony's 10th birthday, on New Year's Eve, in episodes 2469 and 2470; it is Beth's first birthday "at new year" (2468) / "tomorrow" (2469); and it is Emma's birthday in episode 2479. We are also told that Susannah is 40 (2445), and her coffin-plate indicates that she was born in 1960 (2462, 2475) - although Adele guesses her age as 45 (2456); Mick is 42 (2447); Max is 43 (2455); Jimmy will be 50 next year (2461); Jackie is "pushing 50", according to Bev (2463); Tim is 20 (2465); Emily is 17 (2465, 2466); and Rachel is 21 (2468).

Marriages:

One. A marriage is due to take place "tomorrow" in episodes 2445, 2446, 2448 and 2449, but by the time the wedding day arrives, later in episode 2449 and in episode 2450, Susannah is no longer able to marry Mick. Bev and Dave set a wedding date of 12th June 2001 in episode 2468, but their engagement also comes to an end - without anybody dying - in episode 2470. So that leaves Ray Hilton and Jessie Shadwick as the happy couple - they marry in episode 2472 at Merseyside Register Office. Kitty says it will lead Ray to penury and an early grave. In episode 2449 Lance and Leanne recall the wedding of their cousin Linda, who turned down Leanne as a bridesmaid, and - for reasons Lance never found out, but at which viewers can make a reasonable guess - ended up having to make her way down the aisle on a pair of crutches! Jackie and Jimmy have been married for 25 years (2480), and Hugh is divorced (2457).

Deaths:

None. It was previously revealed in episode 2444 that Susannah Morrisey had died, and we discover at the end of episode 2448 that the heel of her shoe broke, causing her to fall down the stairs, while she was having a confrontation with one of her last visitors. The causes of her death are deemed to be a fractured skull and blood clot to the brain, although she would have been able to regain consciousness briefly and unsuccessfully attempt to reach her telephone to call for help (2458); her coffin-plate, seen in episodes 2462 and 2475, reveals that she died in the year 2000; her funeral, seen in episode 2475, takes place at 2.00 (2472) on a Tuesday (2472, 2473); and in episode 2482 it is three months since she died. It is a year since Mark died in episode 2475; and unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters also mentioned are Ray's first wife Renee (2455, 2472), who died a year ago (2455); Ray's father (2455); Susannah and Lisa's father (2458); Brigid's sister Siobhan (2459); Brigid's mother (2461); Frank[y], Jimmy's brother (2461); Frank, Vonnie's husband (2461); and Mrs [Lil] Harrington (2472).

Toilet visits:

Leanne (2449); Jacqui (2452 and 2465); Marty (2452 and 2455); two unnamed women (2458); Kitty (2458); Emily (2465); Tara (2465); Diane (2469 and 2472, twice); and Adele (2472); and Emma fills her nappy in episode 2472. And when the videotape of Jessie and Ray's wedding in episode 2472 is seen played back in episode 2474, it is found to contain footage of Ron peeing. Although Robbie claims to have been doing this in episode 2465, he was actually beating up Carl; and Jerome's claim that he is going to the toilet in episode 2479 is only an excuse so that he can go and talk to Nisha.

Characters mentioned, so far unseen, but who will be appearing later:

Robbie's mother (2457, 2460); Fred / Frederico (2462, 2463, 2465, 2466, 2468, 2477, 2479 / 2464), Lance's boyfriend; Katrina's father (2468); and Jan, Marty's first wife (2469).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Greg / Greg Shadwick (2445, 2472 / 2447); Nathan (2445, 2449, 2453, 2455, 2457, 2465, 2483); Gemma / Gemms (2446, 2449, 2455, 2457 / 2456); Jason / Jase (2447, 2455, 2461, 2465 / 2472); Matthew (2448, 2465, 2467, 2469, 2475, 2478); Emily [Farnham] (2448, 2465, 2467, 2469, 2475, 2478); Josie (2449); Gary [Stanlow] (2452, 2469); Peter [Phelan] (2452, 2453); Val (2453, 2464, 2465, 2484); Bev's mother (2453); Patricia (2455); Minty (2456); Sinbad (2457, 2460, 2465); Paula (2459, 2485); Demi (2460); Billy (2461); Ben (2465); Tony (2467, 2478); Callum Finnegan (2470); the Finnegans (2470, 2482); Leanne and Lance's mother (2471, 2480) and father (2471); Bernie / Bernard (2472 / 2474); Kathy (2473); Karen [Dalton] (2473); Mark (2475); Bernie [Connor] (2477, 2479); Kiev (2483); and the Pope (2483).

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Linda, a married cousin of Leanne and Lance (2449); Richard, a friend of Anthony (2453); Mr McDonald, who wrote the school nativity play (2459); Robbie's nan (2460); Diane's father (2461); Fred's nephews, nieces and cousins (2463); Mr James Hughes, who is summoned to Court Three (2466); Johnny Geddes, a mate of Jerome from University (2466); Conchita, a friend of Fred (2466); Tommy, Cheryl's husband (2467); Shelley's mother (2469); Jeannie, Bernie's wife (2472); Mrs Harrington's "rellies" [relatives], who she fell out with (2472); Clint's Nan (2474); Mrs McGivern, Adele's teacher (2474); Leanne's Grandma (2475); Elliot, a friend of Josh (2476); Kathy Robinson and Bridie Thingy, "Great Grannies" (2476); Sonny Freeman, a friend of Mick (2476); Lois, a relative of Vonnie who now lives in Canada (2476); Mrs Stack, a patient (2480); Anna Mason, who has been bitten by Josh (2480); Catherine Godfrey, who once bit Lance and was then bitten by Leanne (2480); Nurse Susan (2480); Chris Dunn, Bev's private investigator (2481); and Barney, Robbie's mate (2483).

Goofs:

In episode 2457, Victoria adds an extra word: "I'm not surprised - he's probably worried about what you're getting IT up to on his sofa.".

In episode 2463, Marty's second and third words switch places: "You'll be certainly well looked after there.".

The postcode of Emily and Jessie's address in Brookside Close is incorrectly shown as L12 OBE on the visiting order which Tim has sent Emily inviting her to visit him at 10am on 27/12/00, and Jessie is seen reading in episode 2468 - and, although there is a space printed for the name/location of the prison, it is left blank.

Jackie is slightly inaccurate in episode 2480, as the person to be told is Jimmy: "She said if I don't tell her, she will.".

Trivia:

The videotape watched by Susannah and Max is labelled "SUSANNAH'S CHILDHOOD" (2446, 2465), and opens with a caption reading "SUMMER 1969" (2447); the co-starring teddy-bear is called "Smudge" (2448); and the funeral director tries to interest Max in coffins from the "Windermere" range, or the less grand "Coniston" range (2459). Nisha lives with a student, off Princess Avenue (2465); Kitty lived in Liverpool for 47 years (2472), and recalls that before moving to the Close she was in "Shady Pines" retirement home (2458); and Bev discovers that Dave is staying at "The Shire House Hotel" in Chester, and confronts him there (2482). Diane is seen singing along to "I Got You Babe" by "UB40" in episode 2449 and "The Look Of Love" by "ABC" in episode 2451; Anthony studies a book, "The British Medical Association FAMILY DOCTOR Home Adviser" in episode 2461; and a book "The Vampire In Europe", by Montague Summers, is seen in the Corkhills' in episode 2477. Ron claims that he was nearly picked to play football for Liverpool Schoolboys (2454); Darren has known Victoria for 10 years (2447); and Carl, now a talent scout of the agency "Technique", studied photography and media studies at college (2455).

The yet-to-be-seen Fred, Lance's boyfriend, speaks fluent Portuguese (2462), and resembles Freddie Mercury (2464). Lance once got the sack for thieving, but cleared his name (2484); he has complete video collections of "Tenko" and "The Duchess Of Duke Street" (2483); and his favourite films are "Die Hard" and "Shallow Grave" (2447). Bev's favourite television programme when she was younger was "Little House On The Prairie" - she particularly remembers "when Mary went blind" - and Victoria's favourite was "Belle and Sebastien" (2453). Darren's favourite programme was, and still is, "Doctor Who" - he regards "The Three Doctors" as a classic story, and his favourite Doctor is [Jon] Pertwee. Robbie and Clint are also fans, although Clint prefers Tom Baker. Katie remembers seeing Davros, "the Dalek fella", and says that Ron reminds her of him. [Presumably she is thinking of the craggy face, rather than the central single eye, the single arm or the Dalek base!] (2453). Among the presents she has bought for Clint in episode 2463 is an old "Doctor Who" annual; and her slimming classes, "Bodywise", take place at 12.30pm on Tuesdays, according to her poster seen in episode 2462. Harry's favourite "Tweenie" is "Scoop the Digger" (2445),

The travel confirmation Bev gives Lance in episode 2466 indicates that she has booked with Manor Park First Step Travel, 15 Heysham Lane, Manor Park, Liverpool 43, whose telephone number is 0151 496 6549, and whose fax number is 0151 496 5496. It is dated Wednesday 20th December 2000, and shows that Lance is booked to fly from Manchester to Rio De Janeiro on flight NA 233 on Thursday 21st December 2000 at 1635, and is returning on flight NA 235 on Thursday 4th January 2000 [a not unrealistic typo - it should read 2001!!] at 1455. The flight operator is "Northern Air". Bev says he is going "tomorrow" - but he is not seen setting off until episode 2468, which is set on 27th December 2000. It would appear that he persuaded her that a fortnight away was too much, and to rearrange the booking for a shorter stay - as he returns in episode 2477, after "ten days" of unadulterated bliss!

A visiting order for Tim seen briefly on-screen in episode 2468 shows an almost-correct address for Emily and Jessie, and invites Emily to visit him at 10am on 27/12/00; Lindsey's mobile phone number, visible on the display of Shelley's mobile in episode 2460, is 0793 939 0128; and a motorised milk van bearing the name HARRISON'S DAIRIES, the address 27-29 BELMONT ROAD, LIVERPOOL L6 5BG and the telephone number 0151 263 4236 is seen driving into the Close at the beginning of episode 2454. There is art by Claude Monet (2464) and Robert Delaunay at Susannah's (2447, 2448, 2478), there is still art by Mark Rothko (2450, 2479) and Richard Diebenkorn (2453, 2483) in Victoria's flat; there is still a poster of Britney Spears in Emily's bedroom (2449, 2458); and there is a poster of "SHAFT" in Nisha's flat (2477). Darren (2445, 2481, 2482), Mick (2449), a psychologist (2458), Katie (2462), Nisha (2463), Marty (2468), Lindsey (2473), Josh (2480), Lance (2483, 2484) and Shelley (2485) are all right-handed, whereas Leanne (2459), Jimmy (2461, 2478) and Bev (2481) are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

When Shelley turns up at Jackie's door in episode 2454, the song playing on Jackie's radio is "My Kind Of Girl".

In episode 2475, there are some marvellous reaction shots of the members of the small gathering in the church for Susannah's funeral as the vicar, who has never met her, sings her praises with observations not entirely consistent with the way they saw her behaving when she was alive.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Lindsey cries in her bedroom, and is joined by Jackie, who hopes that they can get back to normal now that Shelley has gone. But Lindsey says she loves Shelley. She is still in love with her. And Shelley has gone because of Jackie. Jackie tries to apologise, but Lindsey doesn't care - she is not listening to any more, and tells her mother to leave. "I hate you, and you know that. Get out!".
