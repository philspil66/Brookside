Jimmy is keen to discover more, when Stuart reveals that he has stolen a theodolite from some surveyors in the woods.

Episode 2863 (Sa 05-07-03 "Guessing") Written by Roy Boulter or Maurice Bessman - Ruth regrets not being more helpful to Debbie at times of need, and arguing with her on the subject of showing good judgement when it comes to relationships.

Episode 2870 (Sa 19-07-03 "Regretting") Written by Neil Jones - Mike tries to persuade Jan to go away with him - but she won't let him walk out on his young family, as his approach of taking the easy option is how she ended up missing out on eleven years with her children and husband.

Notes:

The appearances of Eddie Wilson and Shane Ladd in episode 2827, Susannah Morrisey in episode 2839, and Nisha Batra, Ron Dixon and Mike Dixon in episode 2846, are only in flashbacks to sequences originally seen in earlier episodes. Sean Fay is only seen and heard in episode 2855 on a video recording of a scene that was originally seen in episode 2855, and although Josh is seen and heard in episode 2856 only on a video recording of his performance that Ron and Bev are watching, it still includes new material (see "Goofs" below).

Marty and Jan listen to "The Look Of Love" by "ABC" in episode 2827; there is a montage of scenes involving Gary, musically accompanied by "You're The Best Thing" by "The Style Council" in episode 2844, and there is a series of slow-motion scenes of him leaving the surgery, accompanied by the sound of a pulsating heartbeat, in the same episode. Mike plays a cassette of the song "Poor Misguided Fool" by "Starsailor" while leaving Rachel in episodes 2869 and 2870; and in the latter episode it then accompanies other scenes too - including one at the Murrays', in which it seems to be playing on their radio. "Keep On Moving" by "5ive" accompanies several scenes at the beginning of episode 2871.

Incidental music is also featured in episodes 2827, 2839 (accompanying a montage of scenes involving only Gabby), 2843 (accompanying a lengthy montage of scenes of the Gordon family at the end of the episode), 2857 (accompanying a lengthy montage of scenes of Tim and Steve training), 2860 and 2861.

We hear at length the "thoughts" of Ron at the beginning of episode 2829 - and again, more briefly, on four further occasions - in his first scene in episode 2830, at the end of episode 2830, at the beginning of episode 2831, and almost at the end of episode 2831. We also hear just one brief "thought" each from Marty and Jan as they prepare to remarry at the beginning of episode 2832, and some "thoughts" from Jimmy at the beginning of episode 2853.

A close-up of part of a previously-seen newspaper article "BY ADAM ROWE" showing Terry's photograph is briefly seen on-screen in episode 2827, as Steve remembers it in his mind; an unseen conversation between Jimmy and Nikki is heard as if in Jimmy's mind as we see him on his way to a job interview in episode 2835; we see Jacqui and Gary as Max imagines them together on two occasions in episode 2844, and on two further occasions in episode 2845; and in episode 2845 there is also a series of cross-faded images of Gabby, with accompanying cross-faded sounds, as she listens to a lengthy series of messages left for her by Gary. An exciting montage of cross-faded scenes of Katie doing nothing is seen in episode 2848.

We see Josh dreaming of his performance in the school play at the beginning of episode 2854; and, while auditioning for Dirty Don, Steve briefly dreams of himself stripping in front of an adoring audience of women in episode 2857. Images of Randy, Dirty Don and others at the lap-dancing club are seen while Tim is heard explaining their procedures to Steve at home in episode 2856, and Jimmy is seen and heard at his computer while images of Tim, Steve and others at the club are heard and seen in episode 2858. Unusually, episodes 2856 and 2857 both have freeze-frame endings; and episode 2858 ends (accidentally?) with the previous version of the closing theme music.

Part of the same scene from near the beginning of episode 2862, in which Kirsty reveals to her siblings that Debbie is dead, is repeated at the end of the same episode - after earlier, previously unseen, events of the last few days are seen. Similarly, further previously unseen events are seen during the majority of episodes 2863 and 2864, which otherwise consist of only a few "current" scenes involving the surviving Gordons. However, the "earlier" scenes in episodes 2862 and 2864 also include several unrelated scenes involving characters other than the Gordon family, whose voices are briefly heard while the last of those "earlier" scenes, showing images of Debbie's death in a car crash, are seen.

There are brief slow-motion scenes of Anthony and pupils in a corridor, accompanied by echoing sounds, in episode 2866; and episode 2868 contains several black-and-white, then blue-tinted, images of Mike and Rachel in scenes that took place "yesterday", as Mike recalls them in his mind while he tells Jan what his life at home is like. Two of these sequences are similar to scenes featured in episode 2867, but are now seen from different angles, and there are some minor changes to the wording and to the tone of the dialogue - as Mike would seem to be recalling Rachel as being more demanding, and himself more put-upon, than was actually the case! And there is a strange "shock" picture effect in episode 2869, at the point at which Mike unexpectedly finds Rachel waiting for him, instead of Jan.

As these episodes continued not to be shown individually on Channel Four, but only as three-episode omnibus editions in a new "regular" Saturday afternoon timeslot - which occasionally turned out to be later than 11pm on a Saturday or weekday, and, in one instance, twelve hours later than the time at which the closing voice-over advised viewers to tune in for the next episode - each omnibus had an added pre-credits sequence of extracts from previous episodes, mainly featuring the characters who would dominate that omnibus. Characters who appeared in these pre-credits sequences, but did not then feature in the episode to which they were added, were Emily O'Leary and Adele Murray (2826); Jacqui Dixon-Farnham (2829, 2832 and 2868); Nisha Batra (2835 and 2847); Gabby Parr and Kirsty Gordon (2847); Jimmy Corkhill, Tommo and Baz (2850); Steve Murray (2859); Christy Murray and Moira (2865); and Max Farnham (2868). The voice of the Clerk of Courts from Anthony's trial was also heard again in the pre-credits sequence added to episode 2865.

The storylines:

Bev moves back in with Ron, but Josh's behaviour gives them increasing cause for concern; and Mike ends up back with them, when it looks as if his marriage to Rachel is well and truly over. But Jan remarries Marty, only to soon have doubts about whether this was really a good idea after all; and Katie gives birth to baby Sophie, although Nic doesn't realise that only Sammy knows whether or not he is actually her father. After discovering that Alan was having an affair when he died, Debbie may be reunited with him sooner than she expects, as she is killed in a car crash - leaving the Gordon family even smaller, but not really any more likeable. Ruth resents Sean's new relationship with Nikki, who graduates; Anthony's attempts to make a new start in another school suffer a setback; and a serious setback to his career, and the end of his marriage to Gabby, are the end results of Gary's unfaithfulness. But Max and Jacqui leave the Close to live happily ever after in Woolton. And, although their efforts to obtain revenge on Terry are unsuccessful, Tim and Steve discover more than once - as does Jimmy - that sometimes crime does pay after all. But Jimmy also finds out that there are proposals to build an incinerator nearby, which may pose a real threat to the future of all those who remain on the Close.......

The tax disc on Tim's van, seen in episode 2827, is dated 04/03; we are also given another indication that the hostages were held for "two days" last year, in episode 2828; and the completion date of "the end of June" for the Farnhams' house sale, mentioned in episode 2838, was apparently reached at some point between then and episode 2868 (see "Moments" below).

Locations:

The majority of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, although episodes 2826, 2827 and 2828 include scenes set in Salford, and episodes 2868, 2869 and 2870 include scenes set in Cheshire. None of these, however, were necessarily recorded at these other locations.

Births:

One - while Gabby and Rachel both remain pregnant (Gabby is 20 weeks pregnant in episode 2838), Katie has "four weeks" to go in episode 2838, "three weeks" to go in episode 2842, when she is eight months pregnant, and is "nine months gone" in episode 2847 - and gives birth to baby Sophie in episode 2848. It is Ali's 17th birthday in episode 2841, which he looks forward to in episode 2840, and is "tomorrow" in episode 2841; and it is Bev's 31st birthday in episode 2853. We are also told that Jimmy is 50 / in his sixth decade / 51 / twice Nikki's age, and then some, according to Margi (2826 / 2830 / 2837 / 2871); Ron is younger than Brigid / about 70, according to Josh (2830 / 2830); Marty and Jan are in their forties (2834); Max is "pushing 50" (2837); Jacqui is "not even 30" (2837, 2838); Stuart is 15 / under 16 (2839 / 2864); Luke is 5 / 6 (2841 / 2862, 2871, 2873); Kirsty is not yet 20 (2842); Nic is "pushing 30", according to Sammy (2847); Nikki is the same age as Ruth (2850); Tommo is younger than Ali (2851); Josh is 10 (2854); Tim is over 21 (2857); Debbie is 44 (2863); Anthony is 14 (2864, 2865); Jan was 8 in 1967 (2868), and says she is 12 or 13 years older than Mike (2870); and Sean is 25 (2871). In episode 2830, Ron says he left school at the age of fifteen in "nineteen fif-", before realising this would give Brigid a clue to his age; and in episode 2870, Mike tells Jan that he and Rachel are the same age [see "Goofs" below].

Marriages:

One - Jan Murray remarries Marty Murray in episode 2834, on the same day as the second anniversary of Tim's marriage to Emily [4th May 2003] (2833). Christy also carelessly gets himself engaged to Leanne in episode 2834, just after we discover in episode 2833 that the wife to whom he was previously married for just six months was called Alison. Debbie married Alan when she was 20, and they were married for 25 years (2842) [see "Goofs" below"]; Jimmy married Jackie on 2nd December 1971 (2851) - and she is now apparently getting married again (2859, 2860); and Sammy married the unseen Richard in 1998 (2851).

Deaths:

One - Debbie Gordon is killed in a car crash in episode 2862. We learn more about the death of Alan Gordon in episode 2828 - it is revealed that he fell 200 feet into the Barnsley quarry in which he was found dead while running away from Terry - and we are reminded that Susannah died three years ago (2841), and both Emily (2856) and Diane (2865) died last year. Unseen, never-to-be-seen dead characters who are also mentioned are: Christy and Marty's nan (2832); their father and mother (2833, 2868); Jan's mother (2834); Nic's mother (2850); and Debbie's father (2863).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Em / Emily (2826, 2835, 2836, 2851, 2856, 2857, 2858 / 2828, 2833, 2835, 2836, 2837, 2851, 2871, 2872, 2873); Dave [Hunter] (2826); Jenny / Mrs Gibson (2826, 2828 / 2826); Helen (2826); Imelda Clough / Imelda (2826, 2865, 2867 / 2834); Diane / the McKenna family (2826, 2828, 2829, 2830, 2831, 2832, 2833, 2843, 2865, 2869 / 2834); Matthew and Emily (2826, 2873); Alan Gordon / "Flash" (2827, 2828, 2841, 2844 / 2841); Scotty (2828); Terry's twin lads (2828); Ray (2837, 2840, 2870, 2871); Jessie (2837, 2872); Lindsey (2837); Georgina (2837); Matt (2841); Jase (2841); Clint (2841, 2847); Kevin Mallon (2842); Lizzie (2842, 2850); Dexter (2845); Jackie (2844, 2853, 2859, 2861, 2862); Wills (2845, 2851, 2853, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2871); Lou / Louise (2850 / 2852, 2871); Owen (2851); Dan Morrisey / Dan (2852 / 2863); Little Jimmy (2853); Hookey Johnson / Hookey (2855, 2856); Katrina (2866); Luke Musgrove (2871); Jerome (2871); Harry Cross (2873) and "Bing" Crosbie (2873).

Goofs:

Although Josh has previously been right-handed - in episodes 2390 and 2480 - he has become left-handed in episode 2826; at one point in episode 2837, Jimmy refers to the audit as "interim", rather than "internal"; and in episode 2838, Max observes that Gary and Gabby have a little one "along", rather than "on", the way.

It had previously been established that Debbie and Alan's 25th wedding anniversary occurred at around the time that he went missing - so the revelations that she was 20 when she married (in episode 2842) and that she is now 44 (in episode 2863) are inconsistent with each other.

At one point in episode 2845, it is possible to see that when Max is accessing Jacqui's e-mails there is the same message "Welcome, Alan" on the screen which had appeared when Alan's were accessed in episode 2842.......and at another point in the same episode, part of the address of the "invalid password" screen he reaches can be read - Documents and settings\Crawford\My Documents\globalgossinvalid.html. - which reveals that it is not a real internet page.

Ali is torn between "I think we'd better just forget about it" and "I think it'd be better if we just forget about it" in episode 2851 - "I think we'd better if we just forget about it." - and he adds an "-ing" to his third word in episode 2863: "Anybody would thinking I was an alcoholic or something." Perhaps he had been drinking! And Kirsty is torn between "make up my own mind" and "make my own decisions" in episode 2864: "I'm old enough to make up my own decisions.".

We see Josh's performance in the school play in episode 2854, and parts of the video recording of it that Lance has made in episodes 2855 and 2856. However, Josh's words "Mum, tell them I need me line. I need me cue lines!" in episodes 2854 and 2855 change to "Mum, tell them I haven't done all me lines. I need me line. I need me cue lines!" in episode 2856.

In episode 2870, Mike claims that Rachel is the same age as him - although it has been established many times previously that she is a few years younger. Then Jan stumbles over a line - "Which is why I'm standing here how - now, with no house or nothing."; and the telephone message Marty spends 11 seconds leaving for her: "Jan, it's me.......I love you.......I miss you.......Can you come home, please?" only takes 6 seconds for her to play back. It would seem that Jan's mobile phone doesn't record pauses!

Trivia:

Terry's flat in Salford is number 98, Swinton Court (2826, 2828), and the chip shop in which Steve meets him is "NEW MOON - English and Chinese Foods to take away (2827). The pond at which Imelda died is near Crookhall Farm, half a mile from the main road (2826), and Brigid gets hot cross buns for Ron at a bakery in Prescot Road (2829). Nic is working on a property in Woodland Drive (2849), and Ron suggests that he and Bev eat at a place in Bond Street (2849). Mr Wilson retrieves his fish in a rendezvous with the fish-nappers at the top of Rake Lane (2861), and Steve is going for a drink in Matthew Street (2864). He claims to get claustrophobia (2857), dances at the "Bare Pit" club (2865), whose main female lap-dancing section is "Bare Bar One", and whose male lap-dancing section is "Bare Bar Two" (2856), and the wording on his van, "STEVE'S HOME SERVICING - QUALIFIED MECHANIC, COMPETITIVE RATES. TEL. 07700 949 649" is seen again in episodes 2836, 2843, 2866, and 2867. Mike's taxi, bearing the name "County Cars" and the telephone number 0151 496 2222, is seen again in episodes 2868, 2869 and 2870; as is another taxi, bearing the name "Centurion", in episode 2870.

Seen partly on Jimmy's computer screen in episode 2858 as he creates it, and more fully on paper in episode 2859, is his flier: "JIMMY CORKHILL'S GARDENING SERVICES. HIGH QUALITY SERVICE FOR ALL YOUR GARDENING REQUIREMENTS. o LANDSCAPING o ROCKERIES o WATER FEATURES o REMOVALS. 07700 900 960". His newspaper advertisement, seen in episode 2859, reads "JIMMY CORKHILL GARDENING SERVICES - No job too small - PHONE 07700 900960"; and he is seen searching for information on "Roccine Property Management", which he discovers is a subsidiary of "Cinerco" (2866). Headlines of related newspaper articles, seen on his computer screen, are "PROTESTORS BLOCK ACCESS TO INCINERATOR SITE", "INCINERATOR - OUR CHILDREN WILL SUFFER", and "ASTHMA THREAT TO INCINERATOR RESIDENTS" (2866). The sign above the nail-bar, "Emily's" is briefly seen in episode 2846, and the "For Sale" sign bearing the name "Fletcher's" and the telephone number 0151 629 1876 is still outside the Farnhams' in episodes 2835, 2836, 2840, 2841, 2846, 2853, 2854, 2866, 2870 and 2871.

Sean, who has two GCSE's (2849), pays top-rate tax (2849), and was present at Luke's birth (2848), originally met Ruth in a gutter in Faliraki (2850). Debbie has done all her own washing since she was 13 (2863); and Ali and Stuart once had a goldfish, which only lasted a week (2860). On the Gordons' computer in episode 2842, we see a document headed "Movement EGR 17253 - Carrier: PAN/EURO" listing jobs 1740, 1723, 1724 and 1725, on which the consignors listed are Kafka, Orwell, Plumwood and Mowrem; then a www . globalgoss . com home page with the words "Welcome, Alan", and lists of e-mails from Newberry Springs ("Route 66"), Geoff ("No Subject"), Ian Jones ("Mind Your Manners"), Liz Mullin ("No Subject"), Kibble-White ("Complaint"), Alan Newton ("I send you this....."), Tom Jackson ("Opening Times", Nigel Smith ("Club Membership"); Rachel Gregory ("No subject"); Search Alert ("Loose Weight in 40 days"), Jennifer Whiteside ("Health Club Membership"); Dave Scully ("No subject"); Martin ("Loose Weight in 40 days") and several from "Jules". On page 21 of 29 of "Trash" Kirsty studies one sent from her to Alan Gordon dated Wed 17th Jul 2002 - "Miss You! xx"; and print-outs of other e-mails he has sent her, dated 03/05/02 and 19/09/02, are seen later on in the same episode.

Alan, who got drunk at Christmas 1992 and slept through Christmas dinner (2842), apparently had several of the same contacts as Jacqui.......when Max uses an unseen eight-character password to access her e-mail account - jacquifarnham@ globalgoss.com - in episode 2845, the e-mails listed there are from Dave Scally ("Re: Personal Appearance"), Kibble-White ("Re: Complaint"), Punchy ("Booking - The Shelf"), Ian Jones ("Mind Your Manners"), Liz Mullin ("Re: Booking - Bar Brookie"), Kibble-White ("Complaint"), Alan Newton ("I send you this file in order to have your advice"), Freshest Veg ("Re: Recent order for the Shelf"), Bobby ("Pool Maintenance"); Michelle Griffiths ("Wine Order"); Dave Scally ("Personal Appearance"), Liz Mullin ("Booking - Bar Brookie"), Tom Jackson ("Pool Opening Times", Nigel Smith ("Health Club Membership"); and Rachel Gregory ("Your Accounts"). In the same episode, Max also tries to access the account gary_parr@ globalgoss.com, but fails; and the last eight calls he finds displayed on Jacqui's mobile phone in the same episode are from: 8 ) Health Club, 7) Boo, 6) Melanie, 5) Jo, 4) Melanie, 3) Mandy, 2) Health Club and 1) Katie. Mike's mobile phone displays calls from BARBROOKIE, COUNTY CARS, DAD and HOME in episode 2869.

There is art by Sean Scully in the bungalow (2872, 2873), art by Richard Diebenkorn in Gabby's office (2845), and posters of "Cypress Hill", "Nelly" and "So Solid Crew" on Josh's bedroom wall (2831). "Magnolia" is Gary and Jacqui's favourite film (2836); lasagne is Stuart's favourite meal (2861); and beef and yorkshire pudding is Lance's favourite meal (2831), according to Bev - whose favourite colour is pink, according to Ron (2831). Lance's unseen boyfriend, Alex, had a collection of naff Eurovision, skuzzy Britpop and white labels (2831); and Jacqui claims that a "Massive Attack" in their CD collection is hers, whereas those by "Simply Red" and Celine Dion are Max's (2836). Ron claims that the first record he ever bought, at "Rothery Radio", was "The Young Ones" by Cliff Richard, but Brigid persuades him that it was really "Peggy Sue" by Buddy Holly (2830). Jan and Marty used to dance to "The Look Of Love" by "ABC", a favourite record of hers, in the "Babalou Club" (2827), and they originally met at "Eric's" - where Jan used to work, and once served Courtney Love (2868). Marty has known Jan for 25 years (2833), and it is also that long since their first kiss (2834). Jan reveals to Mike - in room 9 of the "King's Arms" B&B (2868, 2869), somewhere in Cheshire (2868) - that "Casablanca", which he studied at university, is her favourite film (2868).

Gabby is seen reading a book "Tips For Tots" (2838); Tim, whose hourly rate for "lifting and shifting" is £9.00 (2835), says he has been reading a book called "Papillion" (2836); and Rachel, whose blood pressure is 115/80 (2844), asks Beth whether she would like to be read to from "Jazzy's Circus" or "Sally's Super Sandwich" (2867). Dirty Don is seen reading "Big & Busty" magazine (2857); the headline on an edition of the "Manor Park Reporter" that Jimmy is seen reading is "BUS STRIKE OVER!" (2859); and Tim and Steve watch "Fleshdance" videos to help them train as lap-dancers (2857). Tim's character/alias is "Rough Rider" (2857), and Steve's is "Thor the Impaler" (2857), and the false names they have given are "Tim Dixon" and "Steve Corkhill" (2858). The alias Jimmy adopts in episode 2837 to steal from the Southport branch of "Formula One Pizza" (2835) is "Peter Spicer". Josh is in Class 7, and the character he portrays in the school play is "Soldier Sam", a toy belonging to "Billy" (2854, 2855); and Lance's shoe size is seven (2854). Nikki expects to owe £9,000 when she finishes her course (2849); the degree she obtains is a 2:1 (2870), which she describes as "just a B" (2871); the letters after her name are B.Sc.(Hons), according to her mirror (2871); and she is right-handed (2835, 2836, 2848, 2850) - as are Tim (2835), Jacqui (2839, 2840), Max (2840), Linda (2847), Ian (2847), Luke (2852), Lance (2853), Candy (2856), and a surveyor (2859). Josh (2826 - see "Goofs" above), Bev (2832), and Jimmy (2837, 2859), are left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

In episode 2829, it is not as easy to read the digits on Ron's alarm clock with filmised pictures as it would be on video - but it is still possible to see that, while we hear his observation "I'm usually up by at least seven", the time displayed is 08:32.

Right at the end of episode 2834, our very last glimpse of Leanne Powell in "Brookside" is also one of the funniest. As she prepares to catch the wedding bouquet thrown by Jan, Christy shoves her out of the way to make sure that she doesn't!!

Jimmy does a deadpan delivery of a very old joke in episode 2851, after Tim asks him exactly what went wrong with his marriage to Jackie: "The gambling, the thieving, the drinking, the other women. Then again, I have to admit there were times when I was just as bad.".

In more of a "jaw-dropping revelation" moment in episode 2868, Ron casually mentions to Rachel, "Did you know that our Jacqui and Max live in Woolton now?" WHAT?????????????? After thirteen years on the Close, they've moved?? And we never saw them go?!

Viewers have the opportunity in episode 2873 to spot that two letters are misplaced in Jimmy's posters - "NO TRUKCS" - a few minutes before Tim, after listening to him speak about the importance of education, points out his mistake.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

It's another minor tear-jerker this time - Nikki says goodbye to Margi, as she gets into a taxi to return home to Brussels. Margi reminds her daughter that there is always a bed there for her whenever she wants, and apologises for spoiling her graduation - but Nikki assures her mother that she would only have spoiled it if she hadn't come. Margi can't believe that she now feels ten times more proud of Nikki for sleeping with Jimmy, because she did it for herself and because she wanted to - and reminds her to look after herself, especially where men are concerned. Nikki reassures her that there's nothing to worry about, as she's a big girl now, living her life the way she wants to - and, as the taxi drives away, and Margi calls out, "I'm dead proud of you, and I really love you." - she responds, "Love you, too.".
