This season features three of the episodes with the smallest ever credited casts - episodes 2532 (Jacqui and Katie), 2545 (Diane, Marty and Adele) and 2570 (Jimmy and Mick). Although there are brief appearances of other uncredited characters in the first two of these, the third is unique in involving two characters only, with no others at all - although several photographs of Mick's family and friends are seen, and on two occasions photos in an album are seen sequentially, as a page of the album turns to reveal the next one, accompanied by a strange sound-effect.

The "Magic Rabbits" music is heard again in episode 2566, but dialogue is also heard - either Anthony is watching them while other family members are listening to the radio, or the music is being used in another programme.

The storylines:

This is a season of break-ups. Nikki can no longer bear Jerome's two-timing with Nisha, and publically humiliates them. Steve and Katrina cannot agree on whether her father made a pass at Diane, and part company. Lance and Fred realise that they have different views on fidelity, and split up. And Clint is taken away from Katie forever, when Ron accidentally shoots him dead.

It is also a season of departures. Mick leaves for pastures new, when Vonnie becomes the latest woman to walk out on him after he plans to rush into marrying her - he will be missed. Leanne convinces Bev to go on the run, rather than face a possible prison sentence for entering a sham marriage - she will be missed. Darren leaves the medical practice, to do voluntary work overseas - he will be missed. And Victoria goes with him - .

Meanwhile, IVF treatment is unsuccessful for the Murrays - but Adele discovers Leo has got her pregnant, and has an abortion. Anthony is bullied into stealing, Ray tries to find a nursing home for Kitty, and Jessie takes in a new lodger. Tim tries to avoid going back to jail, and he and Emily move in with Jimmy - after he persuades Jackie to leave by locking her out of the downstairs rooms and installing a portable toilet in the garden.

And, after Jacqui falls in love with Max, it doesn't take long for Max to fall in love with Jacqui. Is she about to become the third - or fifth - Mrs Farnham?

The dates:

Based on dialogue in episode 2530, the events of episodes 2526 and 2527 took place on 9th May 2001 [but see "Goofs" below]; and, based on the revelation that it is the 68th birthday of Joan Collins and the 73rd birthday of Rosemary Clooney, it is 23rd May 2001 in episode 2533. Based on a cheque dated by Jeff, it is 5/6/01 in episode 2537; and, based on other dialogue, and the revelation that the [General] Election is "tomorrow" in episode 2538, it is Tuesday 6th June later in episode 2537, Wednesday 7th June in episode 2538, and Thursday 8th June in episode 2539. Based on dialogue in episodes 2539 and 2542, it is the same Friday in episodes 2541 and 2542; it is the middle of June in episode 2543, and there are conflicting indications that this episode takes place on the Saturday and on the Monday following that Friday [see "Goofs" below]. Based on dialogue in episode 2543, episode 2493 was set on 21st February; and, based on dialogue in episodes 2552, 2553 and 2554 and a calendar seen in episode 2552, it is 10th July, 11th July and 12th July respectively in these episodes. However, based on earlier dialogue from episode 2463, these dates would instead be 5th July, 6th July and 7th July [see "Goofs" below]. It is summer in episodes 2553 and 2556; it is July in episode 2554; based on dialogue in episode 2556, it is Friday in episode 2557; and there is an August calendar on the wall of Neil's bedroom in episode 2568.

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, with the furthest afield that any character is seen being Wigan - from which Adele is briefly seen telephoning home in a nightclub in episode 2568.

Births:

It is Steve's 21st birthday in episode 2534, and he has "only just turned 21" in episode 2536. It is Darren's 30th birthday, which is "tomorrow" in episode 2543, in episode 2544; it is William's 4th birthday on Sunday in episode 2550; and it is Brigid's birthday in episode 2553. It is the 25th birthday of Jacqui, who is "20-odd" (2537), in a few weeks (2549); she is "25 tomorrow" (2555); and it is her birthday in episode 2556. Max is 44 (2549), and will be 55 in 10 years' time (2550). Approximating, he and Anthea both say he is twice Jacqui's age (2537 / 2538) and old enough to be her father (2547 / 2565); and Jacqui says the age difference is twenty years (2564). More specifically, Clint was 23 (2532, 2559, 2560) when he died; Beth is 15 months old (2537) / 18 months old (2551); Jeff says that 24 years ago he was younger than Katrina is now (2538); Jerome is 21 (2541); Adele is nearly 16 (2543) / 15 (2546, 2547, 2549, 2551, 2552, 2553, 2554, 2568, 2569); Diane is 37 (2555); and Megan is 22 (2559).

Adele discovers that she is pregnant in episode 2533; she is 12 weeks pregnant in episode 2545; she is 13 weeks pregnant in episodes 2547 and 2548; we are told that her baby would be due in December in episode 2551; and she has an abortion in episode 2552. We are reminded that Katrina, "a couple of years ago" (2555), and Jessie (2566), have both previously done likewise. It is seven months / six months and 9 days since Diane lost a baby (2553), when she was 11 weeks pregnant (2545, 2546); and 40 years since Brigid lost one (2548). Diane's baby was originally due to be born on the same day that Adele had her abortion (2552, 2553).

Marriages:

None, although it is Ron and Anthea's second wedding anniversary in episode 2551. Vonnie gets engaged to Mick in episode 2555, but reverses her decision in episode 2558; and we are told that Julie is divorcing Jeff (2531), who married her 24 years ago (2538); we are reminded that Jackie and Jimmy have been married for 27 years (2533); and we learn that Bev and Fred were married on 21st February (2543).

Deaths:

None. In episode 2527, it is revealed that it is Clint Moffat who was shot dead, at the age of 23 (2532, 2559, 2560), while not burgling Ron's house at the end of episode 2526. We are reminded that it is six months / barely eight months / nine months since Susannah died (2534 / 2555 / 2564) on Bonfire Night (2569) [see "Goofs" below], and it is six years ago this week that Rachel's sister [Beth] died (2558). The only unseen characters who are no longer alive but mentioned are Marty's father (2531) and Jerome's father / Vonnie's husband (2557, 2558 / 2559).

Toilet visits:

Katie (2530); Mike (2530); Jimmy (2533); Steve (2533 and 2538); Nisha (2533); Adele (2533 - for a pregnancy test, and 2546); Cheryl (2533); Jacqui (2539); Nikki (2541); Darren (2544); Jerome (2558); Nikki (2564); and Leanne (2566). In episode 2533, a drunken Katie is willing to pay someone to go to the toilet for her.

Mentioned, so far unseen, but bound to turn up later: Jan, Marty's first wife (2536).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Sotto (2528, 2563, 2567, 2568, 2569); Luke Musgrove (2528, 2530, 2542); Mark (2528, 2531, 2556); Craig (2528, 2534); Susannah / Susannah Morrisey (2529, 2534, 2536, 2540, 2541, 2554, 2556, 2557, 2559, 2563, 2564, 2566, 2567, 2568, 2569, 2570, 2571 / 2535); Beth [Jordache] (2529, 2546, 2557, 2559, 2560); Julie / Katrina's mother / Jeff's wife (2531 / 2538 / 2556); Sammy (2532, 2537, 2559); Tony / Tony Dixon (2532, 2564, 2566, 2567 / 2562); Val / Jackie's sister (2534, 2548 / 2547); Shelley (2534, 2553); Matthew (2535); Emily [Farnham] (2535); Jason (2535, 2538); Nathan (2537, 2567, 2568, 2571); Bernard (2538); Leo / Leo Johnson (2541, 2551, 2562, 2563, 2570, 2571 / 2548, 2549, 2554); Josie (2541); Lyn (2543); Gemma (2552, 2554, 2562, 2570, 2571); the Pope (2553); Lorraine Kelly (2554); Ian Leigh (2555); Sinbad (2557, 2562, 2570, 2571); Megan (2559); Carl (2561); Little Jimmy / Jimmy (2562, 2570 / 2565); Brian [Tunford] (2563); Patricia (2566, 2571); Faye (2566); Dave Burns (2570); and Jenny (2571). When Katie refers to "Lord Cuddington" in episode 2632, she is meaning Nathan.

And those that are also mentioned, but are destined to remain unseen forever:

Sian Jones, a friend of Kylie who has to wear a brace (2530); Mr Frazer / "Frazer", Anthony's headmaster (2530, 2531, 2539 / 2533); Keith Hyam, who Robbie glassed (2531); Harry Frankham, who won't go out with Michelle (2533); Michelle's father (2533, 2534), Fred's eight brothers and sisters (2543); old Mrs Donna Jones / Mrs Jones, a teacher (2543 / 2545); Mrs Tan / Michelle's mother / Amy (2544, 2568 / 2545, 2553 / 2554); Jade Ashton, a mate of Adele who didn't get pregnant despite sleeping with half the bus drivers in Liverpool (2545); Abigail, a poor substitute for Jacqui with whom Max has drinks (2546); Ann Crane, a friend of Brigid who swears by glucose tablets (2547); Sister Margaret, who has told Anthony that having an abortion is a sin (2549); Frances Connolly, an abortion clinic patient (2550); Mrs Lewis, a teacher (2550); Quiet Paul's mother (2553); Father Pat's mother (2553); Dr Jay, clinic doctor (2554); Danny Hogan, a boyfriend of Jacqui when she was 14 (2555); Margaret from the Trust, one of Darren's bosses (2556); "Kirsty" and "Andrew", television characters (2556); Mrs Kelly, a salon customer who is having a tint (2556); Sammy's husband (2559); Billy, who Tim met inside (2561); Jed, a contact of Christy (2564); Renee Knutt, a friend of Brigid, and her gay son (2566).

Goofs:

Although it is still the same day in episode 2527 as it was in episode 2526, dialogue in episode 2530 contradicts earlier revelations that this was Saturday 5th May 2001, giving the date of the shooting as 9th May 2001.

The envelope containing a letter from the Immigration Office which Bev receives in episode 2541, but can't bring herself to open until episode 2542, incorrectly shows her postcode as L43 87J.

Anthea's recollection that her close encounter with a car was "last night" in episode 2543 is the clearest of several indications that this episode takes place the day after episode 2542, already revealed to be set on a Friday. However, Bev and Fred are also seen preparing for, and undergoing, their interviews at the Immigration Office in that episode, and the letter seen on-screen in episode 2542 stated that they were required to attend on Monday 18th June.

Anthea's recollection in episode 2551 that it will be 31 years ago in September that she and Ron first met contradicts the earlier revelation in episode 2114 that she was the first girl he ever kissed, when they were both about nine years old.

The date circled on the Murrays' calendar to denote that Diane was expecting a baby to be born then is 10th July in episode 2552. However, that date had been 5th July in episode 2463.

Ron exaggerates slightly regarding Max in episode 2566: "I've lived next door to him for twelve years". It has actually been less than eleven years - although maybe it seems longer!

In episode 2567, what should have been Max's third word arrives a couple of words late - "Do you think she'd honestly get involved with me unless she thought I'd changed?" - and, in the same episode, one of the lines Leanne reads from the e-mail she is sending to Bev - "The police are crawling all over the bar." differs slightly from what can be seen on her computer screen: "The bar is crawling with police. ".

In episode 2569, Mick recalls that Susannah's death was "on Bonfire Night" - however, at the time it was clear that she actually died on Friday 3rd November.

Trivia:

Anthea, who once saw the Pope in Aigburth Road (2553), thinks her telephone number begins with the digits 7 and 2 in episode 2527 - although the balance of her mind is disturbed at the time, as Ronald William Dixon (2528, 2530) has just shot Clint David Moffat / Clinton David Moffat (2528 / 2530), which leads to him being sent to Risley Remand Centre (2530), accused of murder and of illegally obtaining a gun "between 2nd May and 9th May of this year" (2530). After he is released, an anonymous caller rings him from a phone box in Old Swan (2543). A headline in the "Liverpool Echo", seen in episodes 2529 and 2531, reads "'HAVE A GO HERO' IN COURT - Man charged with murder over shooting", and a newspaper telephone poll has revealed 72% support for Ron (2536). Clint's funeral is at St Peter's Church (2558).

Katrina has just bought her 39th pair of shoes (2537). Jeff's wife Julie was his receptionist for two years (2531). His cheque is drawn on account number 4376 5126 32 with the Greenfields Building Society (2538). The account number on the Murrays' £187 electricity bill from Manweb is 214 87 612 000 (2538), and their bank statement shows an overdrawn balance of £619.14, on which they are paying interest at 18.5% (2539). As Marty says they are £119 over his overdraft limit (2539), that limit must be £500. He passed three exams, whereas Steve only passed two (2543). Adele sits a GCSE in episode 2543, "Statistics and Probability" is her exam today in episode 2544, History was yesterday's paper in episode 2545, and she has also now sat her French exam in episode 2548. She is seen with a packet of "Sylph Ultra Regular With Wings" sanitary towels (2545), whereas Fred claims that Bev uses "Extra Super Plus With Wings" (2543). He was supposedly studying mechanical engineering when he supposedly met Bev in "The Casa" in 1991 (2543).

Jimmy is seen with two cards bearing maxims presumably intended to aid his recovery in episode 2534 - they read "ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS" and "DEVELOP A SURVIVAL MENTALITY"; Emily is seen putting up a poster of Natalie Imbruglia (2529); and the first CD Tim ever bought was by "Oasis" (2558). Jessie's blood pressure reading is 140 / 85 (2561); and one of the nursing homes Ray rejects for Kitty, who is in the "General" [hospital] (2541) and has savings of £2,000 (2568), is "Firsbrook House" - which would cost £380 per week (2564). When he plans to leave "Bev's Bar", Lance tells Leanne that if there is a collection for him, he would like "My Name Is Barbra" on vinyl [an album by Barbra Streisand] (2550); and Rachel and Katie are seen returning to the Parade in a taxi bearing the name "Manor Car Line" and the telephone number 269 6699 (2557).

The address IONA AVENUE, LIVERPOOL L70 4UQ and the telephone number 0151 496 0006 are seen again on the back of "Mersey Mover" buses in episodes 2544 and 2554; and the telephone number of Merseytravel, 0151-236 7676, is seen again on the bus shelter in episode 2544. There is still art by Robert Delaunay at Max's (2535, 2536), art by Mark Rothko (2527, 2532, 2550) and Richard Diebenkorn (2527, 2529, 2531, 2532, 2533, 2550) in Victoria's flat, and posters of Kate Bush in Adele's bedroom (2533, 2547). Adele plays a Kate Bush tape in episode 2544. Bev (2530, 2550), Mike (2550) and Diane (2560) are left-handed; and Jackie (2530), Adele (2534), Nisha (2537), Jeff (2537), Anthea (2538, 2553, 2564), Nikki (2539), Cal (2547), Vonnie (2549), Victoria (2553), Anthony (2553), Rachel (2558), Neil (2563), Jacqui (2564), Max (2564, 2566) and Ron (2568) are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Lance and Nikki (2535), Rachel and Mike (2536), and Ray and Jessie (2538) all do something that rarely happens in soap operas - they talk about the imminent General Election.

When Jessie is briefly seen playing "patience" in episode 2538, the top card of the three she deals herself is no good to her - so she uses the second one instead.

The performer Sarah White was visibly pregnant while recording her scenes as Bev McLoughlin-Gonzales in this season - but careful camera angles and strategically-placed props ensure that this is never apparent, with the possible exception of a scene in episode 2552 in which Bev is seen getting into a sports car to go on the run.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

This moment has looked increasingly certain to happen throughout the season - perhaps for much longer - and now it finally arrives. As they sit at the table in the back garden, Max tells Jacqui that she is so beautiful, and he wants her. She assures him that she is convinced he has changed - and he is glad. "Well, I want you to trust me. Because I want to always be there for you. Because I desperately want you to be always there for me. I don't want us to just keep seeing each other, or just to live together. Jacqui, will you make me the proudest, happiest man in the world? Will you marry me?".
