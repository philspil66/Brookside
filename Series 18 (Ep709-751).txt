The Magic Rabbits are seen again, this time watched by Katie, in episode 749 - which ends, like previous Christmas episodes, with an alphabetical listing of the whole year's team instead of the normal cast list.

Part one of episode 750 ends with a giant Christmas tree falling over outside number 10 and blocking the road. As the tree falls, the picture cuts to a long shot of the Close, with three houses and four cars in the background, over which the "End of Part One" caption appears, accompanied by the normal music.

The storylines:

While Tranmere Rovers are keen to recruit Growler, things go much less well for his sisters, as Katie is being bullied at school, and Sammy turns to drink after a joyride results in some deaths and Owen needing a wheelchair. Elsewhere, Paul and Annabelle consider fostering abused child Louise, Sue gives birth to Danny, and Gordon and Rod's new jobs doesn't always go quite as smoothly as they might have hoped. While Caroline is wooed by James, Michael also has conflicts at work, and with his father over his choice of girlfriend, with whom he considers moving to America. Harry finds a new lodger, Mick, as Ralph does move to America with his new fiancee Lana. Cheryl walks out on Jonathan, and Doreen also disappears forever, leaving Billy with Sheila. Not too pleased about this, Tracy also decides to leave, with Barry.......but maybe she will be back?

The dates:

There are very few clear indications in this season: it is nearly the start of autumn in episode 718; it is Wednesday in episode 740; it is December, and Christmas in a fortnight or so, in episode 743; it is Christmas Day in episode 749; and it is Boxing Day in episode 750.

Michael misses out the word "at" in episode 726: "It puts me a disadvantage".

Barry adds an extra "n" to the sixth word in episode 750: "I don't know what you never saw in him.".

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

Almost a year before making the first of more than a thousand appearances as Jacqui Dixon/Farnham, Alexandra Fletcher appears fleetingly in a non-speaking role as a pupil passing by in episode 747.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Billy tries to persuade Tracy not to leave with Barry, but she is determined to go, and, as soon as there is space for their car to pass the lorry taking the children and their Christmas tree back, they are away.
