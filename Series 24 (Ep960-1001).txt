Meadowcroft Park is mentioned again in episodes 970, 972, 973, 977 and 994 ("Meadi Park"), and some images of characters from the series are seen in episode 964, on a tape on which one of the other Dixons has recorded an episode over a film that Ron was hoping to watch.

Goofs:

Margaret adds an extra "all" in episode 973: "The police have been all there all day".

Diana calls Tommo "Neil" several times in episodes 985 and 986, and the only reason she gives is that it's a much nicer name than "Tommo"! We never hear Tommo tell her, or even imply or acknowledge, that this is his real first name - maybe because, based on the only previous occasion on which it is mentioned (in episode 417), it is "Michael".......

Jacqui invents a new phrase by switching a couple of consonants around in episode 1000: "slabe lavour".

Trivia:

For their latest surveillance exercise, Rod is "Davis" and Tommo is "Higgins" (982). Jimmy, who first slept with Jackie when she was 18 (988), is fined £750 (961), and robs Beckett's The Jewellers (963) to raise the money to pay it. Joey says that killing Frankie cost him "10 years" inside (986). Julia hates plain chocolate (974). Freddie "lost" his wife when Diana was 4 (976), because she ran off with a police sergeant (977)! Sinbad used to be in charge of the hens at the orphanage (971).

Ron's alarm for the Moby is from Foxguard Car Alarm Services (993). His mother's grave is in Kirkdale Cemetery (971). DD spent 18 months in a psychiatric hospital (967), where Maria was a cleaner (968). Mike, who was a joyrider when he was 15 (972), played football for the school for a year (973), and reads the book "The Catcher In The Rye" by J.D. Savinger (962). He passes 4 "A" levels, with grades including 2 Cs and a B (983), and both he and Keith play with a "Nintendo Game Boy" (967). Jacqui has been in the swimming club for 5 years, since she was 11 (972). She originally painted the whale on Ron's Moby (972), and currently spells her name "Jackie" (977). The waitress who serves Jacqui and Keith earns £2 per hour (980). Tina has a dog (974). Vicky has booked a band called "The Golden Horde" to play on Friday 4th October (999).

Chrissy attends a course called "Exploring The Chalk Face" (975). Frank was working, and playing for Oakfield in a Sunday football league, when he was 15 (968). Geoff passed two of his exams (983). Sammy was a drunk when she was 16 (967). In his "A" levels, Owen gets a B in English, a C in History and a C in Politics (990). Grace has been with Owen for three months (966). Anne Ford has been Katie's year teacher for three years, and has taught her history for two years (991). Katie, now in the fourth year (991), doesn't like Chesney Hawkes (995). The "Brookside Comprehensive" sign appearing previously (in episodes 870, 888 and 889) can be seen much more clearly in episode 990, listing the headmaster as Mr J.W. Woodcock and, in much smaller lettering, Mr Barnett as the caretaker.

Max, whose pronunciation of the Dutch words he is trying to learn in episode 990 is dreadful throughout, is to be the Round Table Chairman in 1992 (991). As a student, he did a placement with a firm in Clapham for a few weeks (961). Margaret was a bridesmaid once (997). Derek is based at St Andrew's Church (984, 991). Gemma has a doll called Cerys (973). Ellis worked at the NAAFI in Berlin (979).

Terry, who hates Manchester United (990), has no "O" levels (975). The estate agent who visits unexpectedly in episode 976 is from "Binenans", who Harry Cross is using to sell number 9. On the "For Sale" sign, the name "Binenan Estates" is accompanied by the telephone number 051 259 9106 (977, 978, 983, 993, 995, 1001). Fran needs the "Maddox file" (986), Graeme wants the "Marlow file" (996), Sue has worked on the "Kelsey files" (999), and Fran has the "Thompson paperwork" (1001). The scaffolding which proves seriously dangerous to Sue's health is from Carlo Scaffolding, and bears two 051 phone numbers: 448 1666 and 722 8838. The phone number of the callbox from which a call is made following her fall in episode 1001 is 722 0370.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

The band stop practising in the flat above Ron's shop, as Tina thinks she has heard something outside. It is Sue's scream, as she falls from the scaffolding above, her baby in her arms, after an encounter up there with someone she knows who is wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. Another unseen figure dressed in the same way dials 999 from the call-box on the parade, as Sue and Danny lie dead after landing on the concrete below.......
