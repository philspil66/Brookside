Notes:

Although, for scheduling reasons, four episodes (2711, 2712, 2714 and 2715) were originally broadcast in two 60-minute Wednesday timeslots, all were shown in their entirety, with complete opening and closing titles sequences, instead of being edited into artificial double-length omnibus editions. The previous version of the opening titles sequence, in which the bar is "BEV'S BAR", is accidentally re-used to begin episode 2712.

Imelda Clough's only appearances in episode 2712 are in brief flashbacks to the events of episode 2660 - more of which are seen in episodes 2719, 2721 and 2728, accompanied by new images of her in Anthony's mind. Further new images of her appear in episode 2733 - without any flashbacks this time - as she is again seen in Anthony's mind.

The appearances of DD and Clint, and the voices of Anthea and Mr Nicholson, in episode 2719 are only in extracts from earlier episodes - all of which also feature Ron, additionally seen alone in a much older clip taken from episode 1036. Some of Jacqui and Mike's dialogue from episode 2718 is also heard again in this episode; and, earlier in the same episode, images of the Dixons are seen while we hear Gary talking about them elsewhere.

In a bizarre error, Sylvia is listed as played by "SHIRLEY ANNE FIELD" instead of "SHIRLEY DIXON" on the closing credits of episode 2723.

The "NEXT" clips seen at the end of episode 2727 include a different version of a scene from that which features in the next episode, with two lines that are edited out of the final broadcast version of episode 2728 - Marty's response to Anthony's revelation "I killed her!", "Who?", and Anthony's reply "Imelda, Dad. I killed her.".

The Magic Rabbits music is heard again, although the creatures are not seen, as Josh watches in episode 2730.

It is probable that Marty's barely-seen, uncredited assailant at the end of episode 2737 is one of the Cloughs.

The appearances of Georgina Savage in episodes 2742 and 2750 are only in the images of her and Steve which her husband has placed on an internet website, seen being viewed on Jimmy's computer.

There are two brief black-and-white sequences in episode 2754, in which Steve remembers events of more than a decade earlier involving himself, Anthony, Marty and Jan. In these scenes, Neil Caple and Helen Sheals portray the younger Marty and Jan, joined by uncredited younger performers as young Steve and baby Anthony. Neither Marty nor Anthony appear otherwise in this episode.

The storylines:

Jessie and Ray's marriage is under strain, but eventually they decide that they still want to be together.......in Benidorm! So is Marty and Diane's, as he continues to be suspected of killing Imelda, and his ex-wife Jan returns, wanting to be reunited with Steve, Adele and Anthony. Jerome and Nikki plan to marry, but he is suspicious of her insistence that Jimmy gives her away, even if this means postponing the wedding until he returns from a holiday in America with Lindsey and proposes to Helen - who turns him down, even though he has helped her to trace her mother, Sylvia. There is friction between Ruth, her ex-husband Sean, and her boyfriend Dan, as Ali gets a police caution and Kirsty spends a few weeks travelling around the world. Gary and Gabby consider starting a family, while Max and Jacqui would like to spend more time with theirs; Rachel and Mike move in with Bev and Josh; and Brigid moves in with Ron to help him recuperate after he suffers another heart attack and requires emergency bypass surgery. And there are some particularly unwelcome new arrivals on the Close - a gang of armed robbers on the run, with the police in pursuit.......

The dates:

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

[Rob] Dexter / Mr Dexter (2710, 2711, 2716, 2718, 2729, 2730, 2731, 2745, 2747 / 2711) - and a letter seen in episode 2744 refers to "Robert Dexter"; Wills (2710, 2712, 2713, 2714, 2724, 2744, 2756); Susannah (2710, 2732); Steph / Stephanie (2712, 2714, 2715, 2745, 2756 / 2714, 2739, 2740, 2741); Father Pat (2712); Paige (2713); Jackie (2712, 2713, 2724, 2746, 2757); Kylie / Kyles (2714, 2746, 2758 / 2744); Beth [Jordache] (2720); Mrs Tucker (2721); Jacko (2721); Greg (2728); Jason (2728, 2751); Mrs Plummer / Plummer (2728, 2734, 2735, 2736 / 2730); Trevor Jordache (2732); Patricia (2733); Sinbad (2734); the Cloughs' mother (2738); Katrina / Trona / Trina (2741 / 2742 / 2746) / Katrina's father (2741); Ron's father (2745); George [West] (2745, 2747); Mick (2746); Hookey Johnson / Johnson / Hookey (2748 / 2749 / 2751, 2752); Leo (2754); Yvonne / Jerome's mother (2754 / 2744, 2745, 2746, 2751); and Billy [Corkhill] (2758).

Goofs:

In episode 2713, Nikki pronounces "corps" as if it sounds more like a dead body than part of an apple: "Not likely to be joining the diplomatic corps[e], is he?".......in episode 2717, when the ambulance taking Ron to hospital sets off, it has the registration number Y131 KDK and the words "EMERGENCY AMBULANCE" on the side; but when the ambulance is seen again on the way there, the registration number becomes W309 JNE and the words change to "EMERGENCY PARAMEDIC".......and, although Ron's new will, dated 30 July, shows his full name "Ronald William Dixon" in episode 2723, Jacqui's should probably be "Jacqueline Teresa Dixon-Farnham" rather than just "Jacqueline Farnham".

The arrivals of Sylvia on the Close in episodes 2723 and 2724 are very tightly edited, with the result that it is not at all clear that her car is chauffeur-driven - the chauffeur is only ever visible for a split second at a time, and the car is not seen being driven away in either episode, having already disappeared by the next occasions the area in front of number 10 is seen. Although Sylvia is fleetingly seen alighting from the passenger-side of the car in the latter episode, viewers who had formed the mistaken impression that she had driven herself there would later be left wondering why on earth she needed to ask Jimmy to call her a taxi when she wanted to leave!

Although Tanya's mother's first name has been Lucy on the previous occasions on which Sammy has spoken to her on the telephone, it inexplicably changes to Sheena in episodes 2729 and 2738.......in episode 2736, Dan's words to Ruth are "Partner, Lover, Husband" - but she later reminds him that he said "Partner, Husband, Lover".......and, in episode 2737, Max says that it was his wedding anniversary "yesterday", when it is Friday 13th - although it was previously made clear that he and Jacqui were married on 14th September.

Whenever Steve's website is seen being accessed, it is www . steveshomeservicing . com - but a letter is missing from the newspaper advertisement he discovers in episode 2743, in which it is STEVEHOMESERVICING . COM.......the letter Gabby receives from the coroner's court in episode 2744 shows her postcode as L12 OBE, instead of L43 6TZ.......Max's third and fourth words are in the wrong order in episode 2747: "How about what's doing best for Harry and Emma?", and Ruth's fourth and fifth words are in the wrong order in episode 2750: "Luke could have seriously been injured.".

Although Jan appears to pay in cash on her first visit to the petrol station, she definitely pays by credit card the second time, in episode 2757. So surely Adele ought to have discovered her name, and realised who she was, at this point! And, in the same episode, it sounds as if two of the performers are working from different drafts of the script - as their lines sound fine individually, but don't link together very well:

Quote:

NIKKI: Maybe I never told you because every time I say the word 'Jimmy', you see red.

JEROME: And by the sounds of it, Nikki, I've got good cause to be.


Trivia:

Alan's job title is "transport manager" (2719), and his favourite television programme is "Father Ted" (2710). Kirsty gets two Bs and a D in her "A" levels (2724).

Ali and Stuart are seen looking at a magazine called "RIPPLE" at the petrol station (2757). Luke is allergic to cats (2712), and the school he starts is "Digmont Street County Primary School, Liverpool", whose "Headmaster" is Mrs C.A. Wadley and "Deputy Headmaster" is Mrs V.

Local man attacked after police questioning". Mike's advert, appearing in the same paper, reads "Need a fast, efficient laundry service? Call Mike Dixon, 0151 496 0267. No job too big or too small." (2744). He has cancelled the contract with "Swanbank" (2734) without the approval of Ron, who asks Jacqui to have "Someone" by Brian Poole and the Tremeloes played at his funeral (2722). The cost of the surgery he requires is £14,000 (2719).

Lance Timothy Powell (2742) and Bev have been to the "Pacific Star" in episode 2754, and Christy has looked for Marty there in episode 2729. Marty, who is 5'8" tall, according to Christy (2739), originally met Jan in "the old Allinson's Club" (2754). She now lives in Salford (2758), and Steve was 11 when Marty broke up with her (2756). His van bears the wording "STEVE'S HOME SERVICING - QUALIFIED MECHANIC, COMPETITIVE RATES. TEL. 07700 949 649" (2725, 2727, 2728, 2741, 2742, 2745, 2750, 2751, 2755, 2758), as does his business card, on which Ian has added ".com" (2741, 2742). Steve is seen visiting the website www . steveshomeservicing . com in episode 2742; Tim, Nikki, Jerome, Emily and Jessie all take a look in episode 2743 (Jessie wonders whether Georgina is double-jointed!) - as do Adele, Laura and their unnamed friends in episode 2750. As Marty drives Brigid - who was a trained nurse (2731) before Diane was born (2727) - home, he plays "Magic Moments" by Perry Como, which he knows is a favourite of hers (2716). The police contact name and number Diane is given when he goes missing is WPC Miles, 496 3821 (2739). The poster displaying a photograph of Imelda, and the words "HAVE YOU SEEN IMELDA CLOUGH? PLEASE CALL 0151 906 2022 WITH INFORMATION" is seen again in episodes 2713, 2726, 2727 and 2738.

Gabby receives a letter from H.M. Coroner's Court Merseyside, Edenfalls Street, L1 9EF, whose telephone number is 0151 496 4700, instructing her to attend the inquest of Robert Dexter on Friday, 4th October 2002 (2744). Gary describes his mother, Julia, as being ex-LSE and a "hippy demonstrator" (2717). The health club Lindsey manages in the North-East is called "Away The Lard" (2756), and her e-mail address, to which Jimmy writes in episode 2744, is lindsey@ veg-e-mail.co.uk. Nikki's e-mail address, at which she is seen receiving a message from Jimmy in episode 2749, and is seen to have also received e-mails from "James", "Rob" and "Karlos", is nikki@ veg-e-mail.co.uk; and Jimmy's, from which one of his messages is seen originating in episode 2754, is jimmy@ veg-e-mail.co.uk. When Jessie asks where Jimmy is in episode 2716, she is told that he is "up the Ellison Road". She is seen reading a magazine called "FOCUS" (2728); Leanne is seen with a magazine: "The Patio Murders", the first of a four-part series (2737); and Tim is seen reading the book "The Profession of Violence", a biography of the Krays (2745).

A milk float, similar to those that have appeared previously, bearing the address 27-29 Belmont Rd, and the telephone number 263 4236, is seen on the Close in episode 2728. However, the postcode is now the incomplete L 5BG, and the dairies' name [Harrison's] has been blanked out! Sylvia arrives in a taxi from "Manor Car Line" and bearing the telephone number 269 6699 at the beginning of episode 2740. There is art by Ansel Adams on display in the corridor outside the flats above Brookside Parade (2718); there is a poster of Muhammed Ali on Steve's bedroom wall (2750); and there is still a Fletcher's "For Sale" and attached "Sold" sign on "Trina's Tots" in episodes 2717 and 2730, but the "Sold" sign has been removed when the sign is seen again in episodes 2745 and 2746. Debbie (2718, 2726, 2732), Adele (2722), Ron (2723), Gary (2723), Anthony (2737), Lance (2742), Jerome (2745), Jacqui (2746), Nisha (2747) and Alan (2748) are all right-handed, whereas Leanne (2722), Mike (2734), Jimmy (2736), Diane (2739) and Bev (2752) are all left-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

From episode 2712, this might just be Emily's finest moment:

Quote:

EMILY: We are going shopping.
TIM [to Jimmy]: You off anywhere as exciting?
JIMMY: No, but I know someone who is. Helen's going to Iceland!
EMILY: Do us a favour, Jim - ask her to pick us up a chicken and a packet of burgers.

As Diane, Marty and Anthony enter a hospital ward to see Brigid in episode 2726, a geriatric patient waves to them from her bed - and an embarrassed Marty feebly waves back to her.

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Jimmy and Lindsey are collecting fireworks from her car boot, Marty is comforting Anthony after Diane has walked out, and Kirsty is throwing some rubbish into the bin, as police sirens are heard, and a helicopter flies overhead. Three cars come racing into the Close, with police cars in pursuit, and crash into the various cars already parked there - including Jan's. Five desperate men emerge from the cars, dodge the police, overcome resistance by the residents, and gain access to three of the homes on the Close - the Corkhills', the Murrays' and the Gordons'. All of them are armed, and now they have frightened residents and their visitors as potential hostages.......
