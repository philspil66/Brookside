Rachel and Lee become shoplifters and runaways; Jimmy becomes a dog owner; and Sinbad becomes rich and buys number 10 for Mandy - but unfortunately she has started to sleep with Kenny in a misguided bid to clear her debts. Mick is framed for armed robbery by Greg, and although Garry eventually makes sure the police find out the truth, Marianne won't reschedule their wedding and leaves for a new job in Glasgow. Ron also leaves DD again and goes back to Bev; Mike hopes for a closer relationship with Beth; and Jacqui and Katie move into a flat on the Parade. Simon, son of God, dies, but doesn't rise again, leaving Terry somewhat unhinged; and, after the opening of the restaurant "Grants", Barry neglects his promising business partnership with Max and his even more promising relationship with Penny to help nurse his old mate back to health, accompanying him on a trip to Spain. In his absence, the others conspire to replace him in more ways than one with wealthy Round Tabler Sam - and this could be something they will all regret.......

Locations:

There are a few scenes in Manchester, and others on and near a motorway at an unspecified distance between Manchester and Liverpool, in episode 1494; and various scenes in London throughout episodes 1502, 1503, 1504 and 1505. But the rest of the action in this season is set in or near Liverpool, with Sam's home and grounds in Southport being the furthest away that anyone else is seen, in episode 1502.

Births:

None. It is Terry's birthday, which is "tomorrow" in episode 1483, in episode 1484; it was Carl's 21st birthday recently in episode 1485; it is Jimmy's 43rd birthday in episode 1488; and it is Thomas's birthday in episode 1491. We are also told that Penny is 43 and has no children (1476) [so an earlier reference to a newspaper giving her age as 47 continued the trend of the press getting everyone's age wrong!], and we are reminded that Christmas Day is the birthday of both Ron and Josh in episodes 1496 and 1504.

Marriages:

None. It is 22 years since DD and Ron were first married in episode 1477; Marianne and Mick's wedding is in three weeks (1479) / in two weeks (1482) / in a fortnight (1484) / next week (1485) / a week away (1487) / tomorrow (1488), but ultimately doesn't take place (1489); and Rosie originally put her wedding to Eddie back twice (1487).

Deaths:

One - Simon Howe commits suicide in a fume-filled car, with just a little help from its owner, in episode 1481, which is "last Friday" in episode 1484. It is mentioned in episode 1498 that it is three years since Terry's wife and lad died.

Toilet visits:

Bev (1476); Greg, twice - and on the first occasion Mick observes that it's the second time in half an hour (1487); Kenny (1490); David and Barry (1494); Mike and Beth (1498); Beth again (1504); Cracker (1506); and Jackie (1507). Although Rachel claims that she is going in episode 1505, this is only an excuse to enable her to avoid having sex with Roger, and escape from Nick.

Characters mentioned, not seen yet, but bound to turn up some day:

Audrey's husband, George (1497); and Chantelle, a friend of Rachel (1497).

Gone but not forgotten - seen previously and still mentioned occasionally, but not reappearing in this season:

Goofs:

Although it is clearly established on numerous occasions beforehand and afterwards that the renewal of vows, seen in episode 1477, is on Wednesday and the christening, seen in episode 1478, is on Friday, there are three lines in the latter episode which conflict with these dates - unless perhaps Thursday does not exist in these characters' calendars:

Quote:
DAVID (about to set off for the christening): Let's hope we don't have any hiccups like the Dixon disaster yesterday.


DD (as the christening photos are taken): This time yesterday, me and Ron were doing all this smiling in front of the camera.


DD (just before making a show of herself at the christening): You think I care about making a show of myself after all I went through yesterday?!

While most ex-convicts might want to keep their noses "clean", Greg apparently wants to keep his nose "clear" in episode 1488.

David probably means "As long as it's just for an hour" in episode 1491 when he says "Just as long as it's for an hour".

Trivia:

Eddie is referred to as a "Have A Go Hero" in Jimmy's newspaper (1488). Rosie's day off is Friday (1497). Her nan, who used to call her "Rosemary", would seem to be Irish, based on Rosie's impression of her (1487). Mo used to live in Kenny (1482). Lee, whose favourite subject at school is Art (1507), has never been to London before (1500) - and neither has Rachel (1500, 1504). Ron and DD's abortive vows renewal service takes place in the same church in which they were originally married (1477). Bev once saw Limahl in Oxford Street, London (1476). In Jacqui and Katie's new flat there are posters of "Thelma and Louise" (1501, 1503), Keanu Reeves (1503) and Oasis (1501, 1503) on display.

Patricia's Christmas tree decorations cost £2 each (1496). David (1493), Penny (1494) and Max (1493) are all right-handed, and Max was born in Southport (1478). Barry, who is left-handed (1495), suggests that Jimmy hires a car from a place in "Tennant Street" (1481). Among the contactors used on their restaurant are Crown Scaffold Hire Limited, 78 Forth Street, Bootle, Merseyside 20, telephone 051 933 1771/2 (1482). Emma has won awards for hairdressing, according to Ray (1478), and learned ballroom dancing when she was about 12 (1504). When sectioned, Terry is briefly secured at the Mountfield Unit of Fallows Hall (1495). The pantomime profits are £263.70, but the estimate for the repairs to the venue is £250 (1508). According to Julia, Audrey was always picking her nose at school (1496).

"M. DEERE - PARTNER" is marked on one of the doors of the solicitors' office Sinbad visits, at which he collects obtains a Royal Northern Bank cheque from Radcliffe, Crowley and Gill, Solicitors, on which the signatures appear to be "H. Radcliffe" and "L. Gill" (1492). He guesses that the (imaginary) bingo-hall Mandy went to might be the "Gaumont" (1496). Rachel is right-handed (1497, 1504), and so is Beth (1479). The betting shop at which Beth tracks Kenny down is in Broad Lane (1484). Nick is from Manchester, and claims that he hasn't seen his family since he was 15 (1503).

Garry steals a video of Rab C. Nesbitt (1492) for Mick, who is right-handed (1487, 1496) and who is seen reading the "Daily Post" dated Wednesday, November 2nd, 1994, in which there is a headline "Local Cult Leader Found Dead In Car" (1483). Mick spends £220 (1488) on a wedding ring for Marianne, who shops at "George Henry Lee" (1503), and uses one of his pizza crust boxes, bearing the name "Tolona - The Pizza Professionals" to collect her belongings from Litrotech (1485). Garry and Greg carry four more such boxes, presumably with contents, into the pizza parlour in episode 1501. Among Leo's Christmas presents is the game "Ker-Plunk" (1508). Greg, who has a "Primal Scream" poster on his wall (1487), was in prison for 12 months (1488) / two years, according to Garry (1502). Detective Sergeant Sheridan is married (1488), and right-handed (1490).

The "To Let" sign showing Fletchers' telephone number as 051 676 8866 is seen again in episode 1482; the pizza van, showing the pizza parlour's telephone number as 051 269 2434, and the florists' telephone number as 051 269 3826, is seen again in episodes 1484, 1489 and 1497; and taxis from Manor Car Line, showing their telephone number as 269 6699, are seen in episodes 1482 and 1489. The "Shannon Estates" for sale sign at number 10, bearing the telephone number 051 269 5610, is seen again in episodes 1482, 1485, 1501 (when Sinbad has attached his own sign to it "SOLD...TO SINBAD!") and 1502 (when he tears it off in disgust!). In the horse race whose commentary is heard in the betting shop in episode 1490. the winner is "Russian Spring", and "Joseph's Pride" is second.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

While a conversation is taking place in the foreground in episode 1479, something is happening in the background that isn't often seen - a postman is collecting the mail from the Close's postbox! And earlier in the same episode, there are a few scenes in which Patricia and Alice can be seen some distance away in the background, trying to avoid being spotted by Max, who is talking to others in the foreground.

On the subject of Patricia, her response as she is introduced to a visitor in episode 1498 is nicely timed:

Quote:
JEAN: This is Audrey Manners. She thinks the sun shines out of your father's.......

PATRICIA: What's all this "Major" business?


The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Having confronted Penny, Max and Sam about their treachery at his New Year party, Barry finishes off his drink alone at home, throws the empty glass against the wall, and sits down, no doubt contemplating his next move.......
