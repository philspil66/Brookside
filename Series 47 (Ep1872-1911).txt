Unusually, the closing scenes of episode 1871 are repeated after the opening titles sequence of episode 1872.

Matthew and Emily's appearances in episode 1879 are only on the videotape of them with Susannah that was originally "premiered" in episode 1770.

An updated (seventh) opening titles sequence is used from episode 1895 onwards - it is very similar to the previous one, but features the new-look petrol station, through which, from two different angles, a man can be seen walking.

Although the Magic Rabbits can be seen on the Corkhills' television a couple of times in episode 1910, this time their music can't be heard!

The storylines:

Despite the misgivings of others, Nat and Georgia leave the Close for a life together elsewhere, Sinbad sees a possible future with Carmel, and Rachel and Christian prepare to get married. But these are depressing times indeed for the residents - a sexually transmitted disease spreads from Mike to Bel to Ollie, David's rebranding of the petrol station puts Ron's "Trading Post" out of business, some mischief by Tinhead destroys the pizza parlour, and Jacqui's desire to prevent Leanne from offering sexual sevices at "Bar Brookie" leads to her being blinded. And there are three episodes whose content requires specific advance warnings to viewers, as young Matthew and Emily both die following a car crash, and Mick and Elaine help Gladys to end her life rather than continue to watch her battle against terminal cancer.......

The dates:

Based on dialogue in episode 1884, when the [general] election is tomorrow, it is Friday in episode 1885; based on dialogue in episode 1888 and the poster seen and vandalised in episode 1894, it is 27th May 1997 in episode 1895; and, based on dialogue in episode 1889, it was Friday in episode 1888. Based on dialogue in episode 1890, it is Friday in episode 1891; based on a poster seen in episode 1896, it is 30th May in episode 1897; and it is a Tuesday in June in episode 1901. There are 20 days until the end of the month, and it is "about six weeks" until July 26th, in episode 1902; and, based on dialogue in episode 1903, episodes 1901 to 1903 all take place during the first two weeks of June! The end of the month is "a fortnight away" in episodes 1904 and 1905; it is Wednesday in episode 1905; and there is a July 1997 calendar on the Simpsons' wall in episode 1911.

The rest of the action in this season takes place in or near Liverpool - the furthest afield that anyone else travels being Birkenhead Market, in episode 1885 - with the possible exception of the undisclosed location at which Nat and Georgia are seen arriving at their new home with Bel, and meeting their new neighbour, Janice, in episode 1876.

Marriages:

None, although Rachel and Christian plan to marry on July 26th / in six weeks' time (1902). It is Bel and Ollie's anniversary in episode 1881, after which they have been married for 25 years (1906, 1908, 1909). Gladys married "30 years ago" (1887); David was "about 20", and had completed National Service, when he married (1898); it has been 12 years since Max and Susannah's first honeymoon (1901); and Hilary married the unseen Frederick in 1959 (1903).

Goofs:

It is the "Liverpool General Hospital" to which the Farnhams have been admitted in episode 1872, but in episode 1874 Tanya has heard news about Susannah via a friend's sister who is a care worker at the "Royal"!

A scene included in part one of episode 1873, in which Ron tells Jackie that "Little Matthew Farnham was killed yesterday" should have been in part two, or omitted entirely! David only learns of Matthew's death in the hospital together with Julia, who recalls that "I saw him just this morning having his breakfast", towards the end of part one, all of which is meant to be set later on the same day as the accident. It is not until part two, all of which is set on the following morning, that David and Julia mention that Ron has just been rung, and will pass the word around.......

Sinbad is surprised to discover that Tinhead is Carmel's son when he turns up at her home in episode 1888. But after his shop window was smashed, he had already found out where Tinhead lived from Jimmy, and had gone to find him there, in episode 1858!

Tinhead adds an extra word, "was", in episode 1896: "I was meant to bring them with me.".

Susannah says "I'm" instead of "I've" in episode 1897: "When you hate me for what I'm done.".

Dick replaces the first "as" with "a" in episode 1906: "Now's a good a time as any".

Trivia:

Susannah, who was brought up in Heswall (1903), planned to watch the video "BABE" (1874) with Emily, who loved anything strawberry-flavoured (1890), and Matthew. She and Max, who originally honeymooned in Sardinia 12 years ago (1901), were living in Salisbury Avenue when she found out that he was having an affair with Patricia (1896). Matthew was then 3, and Emily, whose full name, "Emily Jane Farnham", appears on an old drawing (1893), was 18 months old (1896). According to the front-page headline in "The Manor Park Marketplace", they are "CHILDREN IN DEATH CRASH" (1875). Max collects their ashes from the "Myrtle Chapel" (1877), and he and Susannah consider scattering them on Bidstone Hill (1877, 1897), where Matthew was conceived (1877). According to Emily's "last clue", Max's favourite colour - of smartie? - is orange (1885). There is a "Winnie the Pooh" video on the Farnhams' breakfast table (1892). Julia gets corn plasters in "Douglas's" (1888).

In the reception area of "The Leathes Head", the hotel at which he and Susannah are staying while on holiday, Max inspects a mounted stuffed pike which was caught in June 1959 by a Mr F. Wainwright (1901). It later emerges (1903) that it was Hilary's late husband Frederick who caught the fish during their honeymoon; he died four years later in 1963; the couple previously resided in Bromborough, on the Wirral; and Hilary, who has no children, now lives in Didsbury, Manchester, and has returned to the same location in the first two weeks of June every year since her husband died. A menu board (1903) and a distant sign (1904) of another local cafe at which Max and Susannah eat in episode 1903 both identify it as "Grange Bridge Cottage". Lisa has been living and working in Brussels (1875, 1876), but gets a new job in Chester (1887), whereas Patricia and Eric are moving to Quebec, Canada (1883, 1886) in less than a month (1886).

Lindsey once entered a talent contest at Butlin's as Shirley Temple (1882). The first time she had sex was in the back of a car, which crashed into a wall (1883). Jimmy was in jail at the time she was born (1874), and was also absent from the birth of Little Jimmy, with whom Jackie was in labour for sixteen hours (1906). Carmel, who has been a widow for eight years (1885), was in labour with Tinhead for a similar amount of time (1906). Her late husband is buried in Knowsley Cemetery (1885). Tinhead, who years ago was off school for weeks with glandular fever (1893), has posters of "Young Guns II - Blaze of Glory" and "Die Hard 2 - Bruce Willis" on his bedroom wall (1898), and earns £1.80 per hour for his work at the petrol station (1898). Ben has been a fireman for three years (1891) with the North Liverpool sub-division, and attended an accident on the East Lancs Road last summer (1880). According to Sinbad, he is late dropping Tinhead off at the petrol station because there are terrible road works in Queens Drive (1896).

Christian, Rachel, Chris, Tony, Paul, David and Philip are the names appearing on a "Bar Brookie" roster inspected by Jacqui in episode 1876, which looks as if it has been written by an eight-year-old, but was actually prepared by Christian, whose belongings include a book by George Orwell (1887). He has a "Manic Street Preachers" poster on the back of the door of his flat (1891), he is 5'10" tall (1893), and he has no brothers (1905). Mike has loaned Rachel a Radiohead CD (1893). Dawn is a second-year drama and media student, who lives in Woolton (1905). Sammy was on the pill once (1892). Leanne, whose rate for straight sex is £40 (1888, 1895), says she was born in an army hospital in Germany (1888). Ollie reads a newspaper in which a headline is "Dallas Gamble Pays Off" (1900), and has been shopping at Sainsbury's (1909). He offers to order for Eleanor, and later gives her at his own expense, a book which was published after Christmas, "The Wall Street Banquet" (1902, 1906). He and Bel, who used to work for "Niven's" (1881), consider going for a meal at the "High Woods" restaurant in Southport, near their old home (1881, 1882). Georgia won the egg-and-spoon race for four years on the trot when she was at Sandbrook Primary School (1874).

From the signature on the letter received from him in episode 1899, Ron's accountant's surname seems to be "McCafferty". Ron used to visit five estates with the "Moby" (1903), and he and his family moved to the Close from 83 Branthwaite Crescent, which now has a burglar alarm bearing the telephone number 260 6576 (1904). Dick's next gig is at "The Montrose" (1905). Gladys moved to Mick's from 25 Crossways Avenue (1885), won a jive competition in 1961 (1897), and used to work for ten hours a day cutting spam in a meat factory (1911). Her late husband Charles had been to Singapore, New Zealand and South America (1885). She writes cheque number 803790, payable to "Mr and Mrs Johnson", from her account, whose number starts off 58040-, with the Royal Northern Bank, whose sort code is 20-77-45 (1894). Before starting to work at the pizza parlour, one of whose suppliers of pizza boxes are "Millers" (1889), Elaine worked in a biscuit factory (1880).

According to a radio news report heard in episode 1878, water engineers have been called to Prescot Road. Recycling banks seen in episodes 1891 and 1894 bear the names "MPR" / "Manor Park Recycling", and "Cheshire Recycling Ltd", and show the telephone number 0151 356 3213; and the telephone number of the pizza parlour, 0151 269 2434, can be seen on its van again in episodes 1889, 1898 and 1902. A "Fletchers" sign, "Office To Let" can be seen again in the distance in episode 1889, and another "Fletchers" sign, "Shop To Let", has been added to the "Trading Post" in episode 1903, and is still there in episode 1906. Mike (1881) and Jimmy (1886) are left-handed; and Mick (1875, 1879, 1882, 1899), David (1878, 1887), Ollie (1879, 1895), Gladys (1882, 1900, 1903), Elaine (1892), Susannah (1894, 1907), Ron (1903), and Clive (1911) are all right-handed.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moments:

Ron reflects on his past, and all things great and English, in episode 1875:

Quote:

RON: You see, it was always my intention to be self-employed. So I got this place off Barry Grant, and I kicked off the nineties in fine style. Me own shop! And hey, you know when that little French stiff Napoleon called us "a nation of shopkeepers", I was dead chuffed, me. Not that I was there at the time, like - but I was dead proud to be English. Because the corner shop was the backbone of the nation. It was the thing that set us apart from the rest of the world. Not now, of course. Oh no, not now, now everything's gone the way of flamin' Europe. Massive supermarkets, hypermarkets, out-of-town shopping centres, now these flamin' petrol stations. They're killing us, you know. Do you know what - we ought to stand up and tell the world that we want our English corner shops. We don't want to be Europeans.

BEL: Do you want a coffee?

RON: Aye, I'll have one of them cappuccinos.


When Markland has turned away after silently dumping Max and Susannah's evening meals on their table in episode 1904, they quickly do a switch so that they each have the right one!

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

Gladys writhes in agony on her bed, grabs her pillow and pulls it over her face. Initially horrified, Elaine tells her mother not to do that, tries to pull it away and asks for Mick's help. But Gladys holds on to the pillow, and Mick and Elaine press down on it to suffocate her, and bring her pain and suffering to an end.......
