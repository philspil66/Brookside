The storylines:

This season sees the arrival of the Corkhill family, whose members, including as yet unseen relatives, would maintain a presence on the Close for the rest of the series. And while it also involves the return of Lucy, the death of Edna, Karen's first days at University and more of the usual mischief with Damon, one event would long be remembered, as three of the residents are taken hostage in their home by a deranged man with a gun. Only two of them would survive the ordeal.......

The dates:

It is reasonable to suppose that most scenes are set on approximately the dates on which the episodes were originally aired. There are only occasional more specific references that it is Monday (279); Tuesday (278 ); the 40th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing (289); August (291); Bank Holiday Monday (295); August 27th (296 - as Matty goes to the interview he mentioned in episode 293 was on this date); 5th November (316); and Saturday (320).

Locations:

All of the action in this season is set in Liverpool, except that Pat, Sandra, her mother, Fiona and Alec are seen in various parts of Glasgow in episodes 297 and 298; Ralph and Harry are seen in various Welsh locations, including the countryside, as they go to Blaenau Festiniog in episode 316, encountering the Railway Guard and Joe Pritchard on their way; and Terry, Pat and Sandra go to London, meeting Kate's family under unfortunate circumstances, in episode 292. There is, however, only one exterior scene of the trio in their Citroen 2CV, slightly lost as they near their destination - and while this scene is set "south of the river" in London, it may not necessarily have been recorded there.

Births:

None. It is Tom's birthday in episode 283, which is "next Friday" in episode 282.. He was 19 when Rowena, now 17, was born (302). In episode 310, Claire is 10 months old, and Lucy's birthday is "next week" - she celebrates it in episode 311. Karen is now 19 (311, 312), Harry is 66 (284), Julia is 64 (314), and, according to Damon, Kate is 25 (285). Edna was born on 4th March 1920 (319).

Deaths:

Three. Kate Moses is shot dead in episode 289 by John Clarke, who then commits suicide with the same gun; and, following a stroke, Edna Cross passes away in episode 298, on Tuesday (299) 3rd September 1985 (319). We are also told that the following are no longer alive: Jim's wife (280); Mrs Clarke, John's 80-year-old mother (284); Laddie, John's dog, who he killed (289); Albert, Julia's husband who passed on "a long time ago" (304); Franky, Billy's murdered older brother (304); Doreen's Nan (308 ); and Fat Eric Norton, a 54-year-old fireman for whom Harry was once a character witness (312).

Toilet visits:

Scenes from two earlier episodes are repeated in episode 310, as Heather remembers Roger at his best and his worst.

"Blink-and-you-miss-it" moment:

In episode 307, Annabelle and Paul look through a number of "recent" photographs of themselves with Lucy, in which she doesn't look quite as she did when previously seen, or as she appears in the framed photograph on the mantlepiece until episode 304. However, it would soon become clear that that IS how she looks now.......

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

This is the second season to end with Heather in tears after the break-up of a relationship. This time she sits sadly at the bottom of her stairs, after Tom has left her, never to return.......
