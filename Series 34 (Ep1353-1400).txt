When episode 1358 was repeated as part of an omnibus edition on Channel Four on Saturday 15th January 1994, another scene was moved into the middle of a sequence involving Beth and Margaret, so that the kiss it originally included was not seen by the tea-time viewers.

The storylines:

A cult becomes established at number 6, as Simon draws Katie, then Terry, under his spell. The Banks family move in to number 9 - including their younger son Lee, who has not been forgiven by the family of a girl he crippled while joyriding. The Farnhams discover that there is to be an addition to their family, as Patricia becomes pregnant, while the Dixon family reduces in size as Tony dies, and Ron moves out to live with Bev and son Josh......or is it his son? We still don't know, as Bev is more keen to embark on a singing career, encouraged by new Legion compere Ray Piper, than to find out. Mandy has an old cell-mate of Trevor's to contend with, while Mick is pursued by Carol, and Beth moves on from Margaret to one of her lecturers at college, Chris. Penny tries to move on by looking for a job and selling her story to the press, while Jimmy's guilt over Tony and Frank increases, as does his dependence on drugs, including heroin. To fund his habit, he turns to burglary - but this is best carried out when the householder isn't going to return unexpectedly and catch him in the act.......

The dates:

It is "Twelfth Night" tomorrow, so it must be 5th January, in episode 1354; and it is Friday in episode 1355. It is Friday again in episode 1358; and, based on dialogue in episodes 1357 and 1358, it was Thursday in episode 1357. Based on dialogue in episode 1365, it is Friday in episode 1367; it is Valentine's Day in episode 1371; and, based on dialogue in episodes 1371 and 1372, it is 15th February in episode 1372. It is April 1st, and Good Friday, in episode 1391; and it is Easter Monday (and April 4th) in episode 1392.

"Blink-and-you-miss it" moment:

The end-of-season cliffhanger:

As "Brookside" approaches the end of its 1400th episode, Jimmy looks set to achieve another successful burglary on the Close. But Eddie returns home unexpectedly - and, until the police arrive, Jimmy isn't going anywhere.......
